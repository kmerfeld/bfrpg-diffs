PART 1: INTRODUCTION

It was our third foray into the dungeons beneath the ancient
fortress in the middle of the river. We were on the second
level down from the ruins, standing before the great bronze
doors beyond which we believed lay the tomb of an ancient
barbarian chieftain. I hadn't believed the tales of the old
drunk at the tavern back at Morgansfort, but for some reason
Apoqulis the Cleric believed him. Turned out his stories were
true… mostly, anyway.

I held a torch for Barthal the Thief as he tried briefly to pick
the lock. He turned around and said, “It must be held by magic.
The lock won't even wiggle.”

Morningstar the Elf smiled. “I have just the thing,” she said,
drawing from her backpack the scroll we took from the goblins.
She unrolled it and began to read, and though I couldn't
understand her words I could see the characters burning away as
she read them, little wisps of smoke as from a candle rising up
from each in turn. Seeing that she was nearly through, I turned
my attention to the lock. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but
the little puff of dust that came from it as she finished didn't
seem like much. She turned to Barthal and said, “Try again.”

I'm tempted to say that Barthal bent to his work, but he's a
Halfling; at just over three feet tall he could look straight
into the lock without stooping a bit. I must have looked
impatient, as Apoqulis leaned over to me and said, “Be still,
Darion, he'll be through in a moment or two.”

Then I heard a loud click, and Barthal turned to me with a
smile. “It's open, my friend. After you!” I handed him the
torch, then stepped to the doors, sword drawn, and Morningstar
joined me, likewise ready. I steeled myself and opened the
doors…

Beyond lay a stone sarcophagus, resting atop a raised platform.
Strewn about the floor were many human skeletons. Apoqulis made
a sign with his hand that I didn't recognize; then we walked in
carefully, trying not to trip over the bones. I noticed among
the bones several bronze swords, covered in verdigris. I
stepped to the sarcophagus. “The lid is likely very heavy,” I
said. “Come, Morningstar, rather than lift it, let's turn it
about so we can see what treasures lie inside.”

[-- Image: graphics2 --]Morningstar called “Wait!” but it was
too late… I had already laid hands upon the sarcophagus. The
bones on the floor began to rattle, then rose up and assembled
themselves in a mockery of life. Without delay they picked up
their swords from the floor and began to attack us. I would
have to wait until later to kick myself, I mused, as I put my
back against the sarcophagus and began to fight the monsters…

What Is This?

The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game system
based on the d20 SRD v3.5, but heavily rewritten with
inspiration from early role-playing game systems. It is
intended for those who are fans of “old-school” game mechanics.
Basic Fantasy RPG is simple enough for children in perhaps
second or third grade to play, yet still has enough depth for
adults as well.

What Is a Role-Playing Game?

In the more than 30 years since the first role-playing game
appeared, much has changed. Most people have at least heard the
names of one or two such games, and many, many people have
played. Still, there are those who have not tried RPGs; if you
are one of those people, this part is for you.

Role-playing games are played by a number of players, commonly
two to eight, and a Game Master, or GM (often called something
else, but the job remains the same regardless). Each player
generally plays one character, called a player character or PC,
while the Game Master is responsible for running the world,
creating and managing the towns, nations, ruins, non-player
characters (or NPCs), monsters, treasure, and all other things
that aid or challenge the players. Dice are often used to
determine the success or failure of most actions that take
place in the game; Basic Fantasy RPG uses polyhedral dice,
described below, for this purpose.

In effect, role-playing games are just grown-up games of
pretend. If you remember playing pretend as a child, you may
recall having some difficulty deciding whose idea should have
precedence… if one child plays a knight and the other a dragon,
who will win? Surely the knight doesn't win every time.
Role-playing games have rules to determine such things. These
rules can range from the very free-form and simple to the very
complex and detailed.

This game attempts to walk the line between simple and complex,
free-form and detailed. Too much detail and complexity slows
the game down as players and GM spend much time leafing through
the rules and little time actually playing. Free-form games with
simple resolution systems demand more mental agility from the
participants, and are much more dependent on the good judgment
of the Game Master to maintain balance. Basic Fantasy
Role-Playing Game falls between these two extremes, having
rules for the most common activities and guidelines to help the
Game Master judge the unexpected.

What Do I Need to Play?

If you are to be a player, you should have a pencil, some
notebook paper, and a set of dice. Someone in your player group
probably needs to have some graph paper (4 or 5 squares per inch
is best) for drawing maps. You can use preprinted character
records (such as those available on the Basic Fantasy RPG
website) if you wish, but notebook paper works fine.

If you are the Game Master, you need all of the above. If this
is your first time as GM, or you have limited preparation time,
you might wish to use a pre-written adventure (called a module)
rather than to create one yourself. Several modules are
distributed on the basicfantasy.org website; the Morgansfort
module, available for free on the website, is specifically
designed for use with a party of new players. Adventure modules
written for other game systems may also be used, but the Game
Master may need to spend some time “converting” such a module
before beginning play.

Using the Dice

[-- Image: graphics4 --]The 20 sided die, or d20, is one of the
most important dice in the game: it is used to resolve attack
rolls and saving throws (concepts that will be explained
later). In general, the die is rolled, modifiers added or
subtracted, and if the total result equals or exceeds a target
number, the roll is a success; otherwise it has failed.

[-- Image: graphics5 --][-- Image: graphics6 --]The 10 sided
die, or d10, is used to generate numbers from 1 to 10; it is
numbered 0 to 9, but a roll of 0 is counted as 10. A pair of
d10's are also used together to generate numbers from 1 to 100,
where a roll of 00 is counted as 100. The two dice should be
different colors, and the player must declare which is the tens
die and which is the ones die before rolling them! (Or, the
player may have a die marked with double digits, as shown.)
Rolling two d10's this way is called a percentile roll, or d%.
These rolls are generally against target numbers, but for the
roll to be a success, the result must be equal to or less than
the target number. So for example, a character using a Thief
ability (described later) with a 30% chance of success rolls
the dice: if the result is 01 to 30, the roll is a success.

[-- Image: graphics7 --][-- Image: graphics8 --]The 4 sided die,
or d4, is a special case. It is not so much rolled as “flipped,”
and the number which is upright is the result of the roll. Note
that d4's are made in two different styles, as shown.

[-- Image: graphics9 --][-- Image: graphics10 --]The other dice
normally used have 6, 8, and 12 sides, and are called d6, d8,
and d12. d6's may be made with either numbers or pips; it makes
no difference which sort you choose.

[-- Image: graphics11 --]When multiple dice are to be rolled and
added together, it's noted in the text like this: 2d6 (roll two
d6 dice and add them together), or 3d4 (roll three d4 dice and
add them together). A modifier may be noted as a “plus” value,
such as 2d8+2 (roll two d8 dice and add them together, then add
2 to the total).

PART 2: PLAYER CHARACTER INFORMATION

How to Create a Player Character

First, you will need a piece of paper to write down the
character's statistics on. You may use a character record sheet
form if one is available, or you may simply use a piece of
notebook paper. An example character is shown below. You should
use a pencil to write down all information, as any statistic may
change during game play.

Roll 3d6 for each ability score, as described in the Character
Abilities section, and write the results after the names of the
abilities. Write down the scores in the order you roll them; if
you are unhappy with the scores you have rolled, ask your Game
Master for advice, as he or she may allow some form of point or
score exchanging.

Write down the ability score bonus (or penalty) for each score
beside the score itself, as shown on the table on the next
page.

Choose a race and class for your character. Remember that you
must meet the Prime Requisite minimum for a class, as described
in the Character Classes section, in order to be a member of
that class. Also note that there are minimum (and maximum)
ability requirements for the various races which must be met,
as described in the Character Races section.

Write down the special abilities of your race and class choices,
as described below. If you have chosen to play a Magic-User, ask
your Game Master what spell or spells your character knows; it's
up to the Game Master to decide this, but he or she may allow
you to choose one or more spells yourself.

Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0)
experience points (or XP); also you may want to note the number
needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for
your class.

Roll the hit die appropriate for your class, adding your
Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit
points on your character sheet. Note that, should your
character have a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not
lower any hit die roll below 1 (so if your Character has a -2
penalty for Constitution, and you roll a 2, the total is
adjusted to 1).

Roll for your starting money. Generally your character will
start with 3d6 times 10 gold pieces, but ask the Game Master
before rolling.

Now, purchase equipment for your character, as shown in the Cost
of Weapons and Equipment section, below. Write your purchases on
your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward.
Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for
your class and race before making your purchases.

Since you now know what sort of armor your character is wearing,
you should note your Armor Class on your character sheet. Don't
forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to the figure.

Look up your character's attack bonus (from the table in the
Encounter section) and note it on your character sheet. Don't
add your ability bonuses (or penalties) to this figure, as you
will add a different bonus (Strength or Dexterity) depending on
the sort of weapon you use in combat (i.e. melee or missile
weapon).

Also look up your saving throws and note them on your character
sheet. Adjust the saving throw figures based on your race, if
your character is a demi-human (see Character Races, below).

Finally, if you haven't done so already, name your character.
This often takes longer than all the other steps combined.

Character Abilities

Each character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of
the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with
each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has a Prime
Requisite ability score, which must be at least 9 in order for
the character to become a member of that class; also, there are
required minimum and maximum scores for each character race
other than Humans, as described under Character Races, below.

Strength: As the name implies, this ability measures the
character's raw physical power. Strength is the Prime Requisite
for Fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to
all attack and damage rolls in melee (hand to hand) combat. Note
that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful
attack below one point in any case (see the Combat section for
details).

Intelligence: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge.
Intelligence is the Prime Requisite for Magic-Users. The
ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of
languages the character is able to learn to read and write; if
the character has an Intelligence penalty, he or she cannot
read more than a word or two, and will only know his or her
native language.

Wisdom: A combination of intuition, willpower and common sense.
Wisdom is the Prime Requisite for Clerics. The Wisdom bonus or
penalty may apply to some saving throws vs. magical attacks,
particularly those affecting the target's will.

Dexterity: This ability measures the character's quickness and
balance as well as aptitude with tools. Dexterity is the Prime
Requisite for Thieves. The Dexterity bonus or penalty is
applied to all attack rolls with missile (ranged) weapons, to
the character's Armor Class value, and to the character's
Initiative die roll.

Constitution: A combination of general health and vitality.
Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each hit die rolled
by the character. Note that a penalty here will not reduce any
hit die roll to less than 1 point.

Charisma: This is the ability to influence or even lead people;
those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly
respected. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to reaction
rolls. Also, the number of retainers a character may hire is
equal to 4 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty (and therefore
ranges from 1 to 7); the average morale of any such retainers
will be equal to 7 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty.

Hit Points and Hit Dice

When a character is injured, he or she loses hit points from his
or her current total. Note that this does not change the figure
rolled, but rather reduces the current total; healing will
restore hit points, up to but not exceeding the rolled figure.

When his or her hit point total reaches 0, your character is
probably dead. This is not necessarily the end for the
character; don't tear up the character sheet.

First level characters begin play with a single hit die of the
given type, plus the Constitution bonus or penalty, with a
minimum of 1 hit point. Each time a character gains a level,
the player should roll another hit die and add the character's
Constitution bonus or penalty, with the result again being a
minimum of 1 point. Add this amount to the character's maximum
hit points figure. Note that, after 9th level, characters
receive a fixed number of hit points each level, as shown in
the advancement table for the class, and no longer add the
Constitution bonus or penalty.

Languages

All characters begin the game knowing their native language. In
most campaign worlds, Humans all (or nearly all) speak the same
language, often called “Common.” Each demi-human race has its
own language, i.e. Elvish, Dwarvish, or Halfling, and members
of the demi-human races begin play knowing both their own
language and Common (or the local Human language if it isn't
called Common).

Characters with Intelligence of 13 or higher may choose to begin
the game knowing one or more languages other than those given
above; the number of additional languages that may be learned
is equal to the Intelligence bonus (+1, +2, or +3). Characters
may choose to learn other demi-human languages, as well as
humanoid languages such as Orc, Goblin, etc. The GM will decide
which humanoid languages may be learned. The player may choose
to leave one or more bonus language “slots” open, to be filled
during play. Some Game Masters may even allow player characters
to learn exotic languages such as Dragon; also, “dead” or
otherwise archaic languages might be allowed to more scholarly
characters.

Character Races

Dwarves

[-- Image: graphics16 --]Description: Dwarves are a short,
stocky race; both male and female Dwarves stand around four
feet tall and typically weigh around 120 pounds. Their long
hair and thick beards are dark brown, gray or black. They take
great pride in their beards, sometimes braiding or forking
them. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. Dwarves have stout
frames and a strong, muscular build. They are rugged and
resilient, with the capacity to endure great hardships. Dwarves
are typically practical, stubborn and courageous. They can also
be introspective, suspicious and possessive. They have a
lifespan between three and four centuries long.

Restrictions: Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves.
They are required to have a minimum Constitution of 9. Due to
their generally dour dispositions, they may not have a Charisma
higher than 17. They may not employ Large weapons more than four
feet in length (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows).

Special Abilities: All Dwarves have Darkvision with a 60' range,
and are able to detect slanting passages, traps, shifting walls
and new construction on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6; a search must be
performed before this roll may be made.

Saving Throws: Dwarves save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison, Magic
Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs. Dragon
Breath.

Elves

[-- Image: graphics29 --]Description: Elves are a slender race,
with both genders standing around five feet tall and weighing
around 130 pounds. Most have dark hair, with little or no body
or facial hair. Their skin is pale, and they have pointed ears
and fine, delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful,
moving with deftness and ease. They have keen eyesight and
hearing. Elves are typically inquisitive, passionate,
self-assured and sometimes haughty. They have a typical
lifespan of a dozen centuries or more.

Restrictions: Elves may become Clerics, Fighters, Magic-Users or
Thieves; they are also allowed to combine the classes of Fighter
and Magic-User (see Combination Classes, below). They are
required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9. Due to their
generally delicate nature, they may not have a Constitution
higher than 17. Elves never roll larger than six-sided dice
(d6) for hit points.

Special Abilities: All Elves have Darkvision with a 60' range.
They are able to find secret doors more often than normal (1-2
on 1d6 rather than the usual 1 on 1d6). An Elf is so observant
that he or she has a 1 on 1d6 chance to find a secret door with
just a cursory look. Elves are immune to the paralyzing attack
of ghouls.

Saving Throws: Elves save at +1 vs. Paralysis or Petrify and +2
vs. Magic Wands and Spells.

[-- Image: graphics33 --]Halflings

Description: Halflings are small, slightly stocky folk who stand
around three feet tall and weigh about 60 pounds. They have
curly brown hair on their heads and feet, but generally have no
facial hair. They are usually fair skinned, often with ruddy
cheeks. Halflings are remarkably rugged for their small size.
They are dexterous and nimble, capable of moving quietly and
remaining very still. They usually go barefoot. Halflings are
typically outgoing, unassuming and good-natured. They have a
lifespan of around a hundred years.

Restrictions: Halflings may become Clerics, Fighters or Thieves.
They are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9. Due to their
small stature, they may not have a Strength higher than 17.
Halflings never roll larger than six-sided dice (d6) for hit
points regardless of class. Halflings may not use Large
weapons, and must wield Medium weapons with both hands.

Special Abilities: Halflings are unusually accurate with all
sorts of ranged weapons, gaining a +1 attack bonus when
employing them. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than
man-sized, Halflings gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class.
Halflings are quick-witted, thus adding +1 to Initiative die
rolls. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are
able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still
there is only a 10% chance they will be detected. Even indoors,
in dungeons or in non-preferred terrain they are able to hide
such that there is only a 30% chance of detection. Note that a
Halfling Thief will roll for hiding attempts only once, using
either the Thief ability or the Halfling ability, whichever is
better.

Saving Throws: Halflings save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison,
Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs.
Dragon Breath.

Humans

[-- Image: graphics38 --]Description: Humans come in a broad
variety of shapes and sizes; the Game Master must decide what
sorts of Humans live in the game world. An average Human male
in good health stands around six feet tall and weighs about 175
pounds. Most Humans live around 75 years.

Restrictions: Humans may be any class. They have no minimum or
maximum ability score requirements.

Special Abilities: Humans learn unusually quickly, gaining a
bonus of 10% to all experience points earned.

Saving Throws: Humans are the “standard,” and thus have no
saving throw bonuses.

Combination Classes

To become a member of a combination class, a character must meet
the requirements of both classes. Combination class characters
use the best attack bonus and the best saving throw values of
their original two classes. One combination class is mentioned
in the Elf racial description:

Fighter/Magic-User: These characters may both fight and cast
magic spells; further, they are allowed to cast magic spells
while wearing armor. A Fighter/Magic-User must gain experience
equal to the combined requirements of both base classes. Elven
Fighter/Magic-Users roll six-sided dice (d6) for hit points.

Clerics are those who have devoted themselves to the service of
a deity, pantheon or other belief system. Most Clerics spend
their time in mundane forms of service such as preaching and
ministering in a temple; but there are those who are called to
go abroad from the temple and serve their deity in a more
direct way, smiting undead monsters and aiding in the battle
against evil and chaos. Player character Clerics are assumed to
be among the latter group.

Clerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as
Fighters. They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower
levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief
would deftly avoid. Clerics can cast spells of divine nature
starting at 2nd level, and they have the power to Turn the
Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of
faith alone (see the Encounter section for details).

The Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom; a character must have
a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Cleric. They may wear
any armor, but may only use blunt weapons (specifically
including warhammer, mace, maul, club, quarterstaff, and
sling).

Fighters include soldiers, guardsmen, barbarian warriors, and
anyone else for whom fighting is a way of life. They train in
combat, and they generally approach problems head on, weapon
drawn.

Not surprisingly, Fighters are best at fighting of all the
classes. They are also the hardiest, able to take more
punishment than any other class. Although they are not skilled
in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic
items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor.

The Prime Requisite for Fighters is Strength; a character must
have a Strength score of 9 or higher to become a Fighter.
Members of this class may wear any armor and use any weapon.

Magic-Users are those who seek and use knowledge of the arcane.
They do magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater
power, but rather through insight and understanding.

Magic-Users are the worst of all the classes at fighting; hours
spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character
to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least
hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but quickly falling
behind.

The Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character
must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a
Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are
the dagger and the walking staff (or cudgel). Magic-Users may
not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things
interfere with spellcasting.

A first level Magic-User begins play knowing read magic and one
other spell of first level. These spells are written in a
spellbook provided by his or her master. The GM may roll for
the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player
to choose it, at his or her option. See the Spells section for
more details.

Thieves are those who take what they want or need by stealth,
disarming traps and picking locks to get to the gold they
crave; or “borrowing” money from pockets, beltpouches, etc.
right under the nose of the “mark” without the victim ever
knowing.

Thieves fight better than Magic-Users but not as well as
Fighters. Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less
hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the
Magic-Users at higher levels.

The Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must
have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief. They
may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it
interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields
of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however.

Thieves have a number of special abilities, described below. One
Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities,
though the GM may amend this as he or she sees fit. The GM may
choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player, at
his or her option, to help maintain the proper state of
uncertainty. Also note that the GM may apply situational
adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees
fit; for instance, it's obviously harder to climb a wall slick
with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a
penalty of 20% for the slimy wall.

Open Locks allows the Thief to unlock a lock without a proper
key. It may only be tried once per lock. If the attempt fails,
the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of
experience before trying again.

Remove Traps is generally rolled twice: first to detect the
trap, and second to disarm it. The GM will make these rolls as
the player won't know for sure if the character is successful
or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected)
area.

Pick Pockets allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse,
etc. of a victim without the victim noticing. Obviously, if the
roll is failed, the Thief didn't get what he or she wanted; but
further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the GM's
option) will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than
two times the target number (or if the die roll is 00).

Move Silently, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the GM.
The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently
regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to
avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.

Climb Walls permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few
or no visible handholds. This ability should normally be rolled
by the player. If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about
halfway up the wall or other vertical surface. The GM may
require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100
feet.

Hide permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough
to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief always
believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the
roll. A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this
ability to work.

Listen is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to
listen for distant sounds in a dungeon. The GM must decide what
noises the Thief might be able to hear; a successful roll does
not mean that a noise has been heard, but rather that a noise
might have been heard. The GM should always make this roll for
the player. Also note that the Thief and his or her party must
try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.

Finally, Thieves can perform a Sneak Attack any time they are
behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the
opponent doesn't know the Thief is there. The GM may require a
Move Silently or Hide roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack
is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage if it is
successful. A Thief generally can't perform a Sneak Attack on
the same opponent twice in any given combat.

The Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not
missile) weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case
subduing damage is done; see the Encounter section for details).
Also, the Sneak Attack can be performed with the “flat of the
blade;” the bonuses and penalties cancel out, so the attack has
a +0 attack bonus and does normal damage; the damage done in
this case is subduing damage.

Cost of Weapons and Equipment

Money

Monetary values are usually expressed in gold pieces. In
addition to gold coins, there are coins made of platinum,
silver, electrum (an alloy of gold and silver), and copper.
They are valued as follows:

1 platinum piece (pp)  = 5 gold pieces (gp)

1 gold piece (gp)  = 10 silver pieces (sp)

1 electrum piece (ep)  = 5 silver pieces (sp)

1 silver piece (sp)  = 10 copper pieces (cp)

For game purposes, assume that one gold piece weighs 1/10th of a
pound, and that five coins will “fit” in a cubic inch of storage
space (this isn't literally accurate, but works well enough when
applied to a box or chest).

First level characters generally begin the game with 3d6 x 10 gp
(unless the GM decides otherwise).

Weapon Size

Humans and Elves must wield Large weapons with both hands, but
may use Small or Medium weapons in one hand. Halflings may not
use Large weapons at all, and must use Medium weapons with both
hands. Dwarves, due to their stocky, powerful builds, are able
to use Medium weapons one-handed and some Large weapons in two
hands, but Large weapons more than four feet in length are
prohibited (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows). Some weapons must be used with both hands by design
(such as bows and crossbows) but the maximum size limits still
apply.

The GM should apply similar limitations to weapon-armed
monsters; for instance, kobolds and goblins are similar in size
to Halflings, and thus should have similar weapon limits.

Missile weapon ranges are given in feet. In the wilderness,
substitute yards for feet. If the target is as close as or
closer than the Short range figure, the attacker gets a +1
attack bonus. If the target is further away than the Medium
range figure, but not beyond the Long range figure, the
attacker receives a -2 attack penalty.

Explanation of Equipment

A Backpack will hold a maximum 40 pounds or 3 cubic feet of
goods. Some items may be lashed to the outside; such will count
toward the weight limit but not the volume limit. A Halfling's
backpack holds at most 30 pounds and/or 1½ cubic feet, but
costs the same as a full-sized item.

A Candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with dim light
extending 5' further. A normal candle will burn about 3 turns
per inch of height.

Chalk is useful for “blazing a trail” through a dungeon or ruin,
to ensure that the adventurers can find their way back out
again.

Holy Water is explained in the Encounter section.

Iron Spikes are useful for spiking doors closed (or spiking them
open) and may be used as crude pitons in appropriate situations.

A Lantern will provide light covering a 30' radius; dim light
will extend about 20' further. A lantern will consume a flask
of oil in 18+1d6 turns.

A Map or Scroll Case is a tubular oiled leather case used to
carry maps, scrolls, or other paper items. The case will have a
water-resistant (but not waterproof) cap which slides over the
end, and a loop to allow the case to be hung from a belt or
bandolier. A standard scroll case can hold up to 10 sheets of
paper, or a single scroll of up to seven spells.

A Mirror is useful in a dungeon environment for many reasons;
for instance, it is the only way to look at a Medusa without
being turned to stone. Mirrors are also useful for looking
around corners, and can be used outdoors to send signals using
reflected sunlight.

A Quiver is an open container used to hold arrows. A Bolt Case
is a similar sort of container for crossbow bolts. In either
case, the standard capacity is 20 missiles. The length of a
quiver or bolt case must match the length of the ammunition for
it to be useful; therefore, there are longbow and shortbow
quivers and light and heavy crossbow bolt cases. The price is
the same regardless of the type.

Dry Rations may consist of dry bread, hard cheese, dried fruit,
nuts, beans, jerky, or any other food which will not “go bad”
in less than about a month (if not longer). Dry rations are
generally sold in quantities sufficient for one character for a
week, and are packaged in waxed or oiled cloth to protect them.

Hemp Rope is ½ inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of
1,600 pounds. Safe working load for a rope is normally
one-quarter of the breaking strength. One or more knots in a
rope cut the breaking strength in half. This does not affect
the safe working load, because knots are figured into the
listed one-quarter ratio.

Silk Rope is about 3/8 inch in diameter and has a breaking
strength of 1,600 pounds, although it weighs considerably less
than hemp rope. The notes regarding rope strength given for
hemp rope, above, apply here also.

A Large Sack will hold at most 40 pounds or 4 cubic feet of
goods.

A Small Sack will hold at most 20 pounds or 2 cubic feet of
goods.

A pair of Saddlebags will hold at most 10 pounds or 1 cubic foot
of goods (divided evenly between both bags).

Thieves' Picks and Tools are required for the use of Thief
abilities such as opening locks and removing traps. These
abilities may not be usable without appropriate tools, or may
be used at a penalty at the option of the Game Master.

A Tinderbox is generally purchased with a flint and steel; the
flint, a piece of hard rock, is struck vigorously against a
C-shaped piece of high-carbon steel. When done correctly, hot
sparks will fly from the flint and steel into the tinder,
hopefully starting a fire. The best tinder is a dried piece of
prepared tinder fungus, carried in the tinderbox to keep it
dry; char cloth, hemp rope, or even very dry grass can
substitute if prepared tinder fungus is not available. The time
required to start a fire should be determined by the GM
according to the prevailing conditions; under ideal conditions,
starting a fire with a flint, steel and tinder takes about a
turn.

A Torch sheds light over a 30' radius, with dim light extending
about 20' further, and burns for 1d4+4 turns. Of course, a
torch is also useful for setting flammable materials (such as
cobwebs or oil) alight.

A Whetstone is used to sharpen and maintain edged weapons such
as swords, daggers, and axes.

Wineskin/Waterskin is a container for drinking water or wine;
though generally water is taken into a dungeon or wilderness
environment. The standard waterskin holds one quart of liquid,
which is the minimum amount required by a normal character in a
single day. If adventuring in the desert or other hot, dry
areas, a character may need as much as ten times this amount.
Note that the given 2 pound weight is for a full skin; an empty
skin has negligible weight.

Vehicles

The following tables give details of various land and sea
vehicles. Game Masters should feel free to create their own
vehicles, in which case the table can be used for guidance.

Notes Regarding Vehicles

The Crew figure given reflects the minimum number of sailors
and/or rowers needed to operate the ship. Officers are not
counted among these numbers, and of course it is always a good
idea to hire extra sailors and/or rowers to ensure that any
casualties will not slow down the ship.

Cargo for wagons is given in pounds, while for ships it is given
in tons. If the ship sails night and day, each passenger
requires living space equivalent to one ton of cargo; in
addition, provisions for one man for one month occupy 1/10 of a
ton of space.

Movement is given separately here in feet (yards, actually; see
Time and Scale in Part 4: The Adventure for an explanation) as
well as miles per day. The encounter movement of ships is not
directly related to the long-distance travel rate, since the
crew must work hard to make the ship move quickly in combat,
and this level of effort cannot be maintained day and night.

See Attacking a Vehicle in the Encounter section for details on
the Hardness and HP statistics.

A chariot requires a single horse, generally a warhorse, to pull
it. Both coaches and wagons require at least a pair of draft
horses to pull them.

A caravel is a highly maneuverable sailing ship with two or
three masts. Though superficially similar to the larger
carrack, caravels are capable of sailing up rivers, a task for
which the larger ship is ill suited.

A carrack is a large, ocean-going sailing ship with three or
four masts.

Galleys are equipped with both sails and oars; the second listed
movement rate for galleys is the rowing speed. A small galley
will have around 20 rows of oars, with each oar pulled by two
men (for a total of 80 rowers) while a large galley will have
around 35 rows of oars (for a total of 140 rowers). Galleys are
generally much more maneuverable than sailing ships such as the
carrack or caravel, and may be outfitted with rams.

The longship commonly used by northern raiders is very similar
to the large galley. However, where more civilized nations have
specialist rowers, sailors, and marines, the crew of a longship
is more generalized; every crewman is usually qualified for all
of these tasks.

Siege Engines

These are weapons used to attack strongholds, or sometimes
ships. Their cost may be up to twice as high in a remote
location. A siege engine that throws missiles (a ballista,
onager or trebuchet) must have a trained artillerist to fire
it; this is the character who makes the attack rolls for the
weapon. Missile-throwing engines have attack penalties,
detailed below. Note: siege engines are not generally usable
against individuals or monsters; the GM may make exceptions for
very large monsters like giants or dragons.

Ballista: This is effectively a very large crossbow that may
fire a spear-like bolt or a large stone. It is usually mounted
on a tripod or wagon, but may also be mounted on a ship. When
firing bolts, a ballista cannot damage brick or stone. A
ballista requires a crew of three to operate.

Battering Ram: These are usually operated under a sow (a sort of
portable roof). They require a crew of eight or more.

Onager: This weapon throws a stone with a fairly flat
trajectory. An onager requires a crew of four to operate.

Trebuchet: This mighty weapon uses a counterweight to fling a
stone on a high, arcing path. It cannot fire at targets within
200 yards. If it is aimed at a target that is more than 20’
higher than the weapon, there is an additional –2 attack
penalty. A trebuchet requires a crew of eight to operate.

PART 3: SPELLS

The number of spells of each level which a Cleric or Magic-User
may cast per day is shown on the appropriate table in the
Characters section, above. Each day, usually in the morning,
spellcasters prepare spells to replace those they have used.
Clerics do this through prayer, while Magic-Users must study
their spellbooks. Spells prepared but not used persist from day
to day; only those actually cast must be replaced. A spellcaster
may always choose to dismiss a prepared spell (without casting
it) in order to prepare a different spell of that level.

Spellcasters must have at least one hand free, and be able to
speak, in order to cast spells; thus, binding and gagging a
spellcaster is an effective means of preventing him or her from
casting spells. In combat, casting a spell usually takes the
same time as making an attack. If a spellcaster is attacked on
the Initiative number on which he or she is casting a spell,
the spell is spoiled and lost.

Some spells are reversible; such spells are shown with an
asterisk after the name.

Cleric Spells

Clerics receive their spells through faith and prayer. Each day,
generally in the morning, a Cleric must pray for at least three
turns in order to prepare spells. Of course, the Cleric may be
expected to pray more than this in order to remain in his or
her deity's good graces.

Because they gain their spells through prayer, a Cleric may
prepare any spell of any level he or she is able to cast.
However, in some cases the Cleric's deity may limit the
availability of certain spells; for instance, a deity devoted
to healing may refuse to grant reversed healing spells.

Magic-User Spells

Magic-Users cast spells through the exercise of knowledge and
will. They prepare spells by study of their spellbooks; each
Magic-User has his or her own spellbook, containing the magical
formulae for each spell the Magic-User has learned, written in a
magical script that can only be read by the Magic-User who wrote
it, or through the use of a special first-level spell: read
magic. All Magic-Users begin play with read magic as their
first spell, and it is so ingrained that a Magic-User can
prepare it without a spellbook. Read magic has a range of
“touch” and is permanent with respect to any given magical
work (spellbook or scroll).

Magic-Users may learn spells by being taught directly by another
Magic-User, or by studying another Magic-User's spellbook. If
being taught, a spell can be learned in a single day;
researching another Magic-User's spellbook takes one day per
spell level. Either way, the spell learned must be transcribed
into the Magic-User's own spellbook, at a cost of 500 gp per
spell level transcribed. A beginning Magic-User starts with a
spellbook containing read magic and at least one other
first-level spell, as determined by the GM, at no cost.

All Spells, in Alphabetical Order

Animate Dead  Range:  touch

Cleric 4, Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into
undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken
commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The
caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to
twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons
have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for
skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die,
regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have
one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated
skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a
zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The
caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may
normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or
her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.

Animate Objects  Range:  100'+10'/level

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a
semblance of life. The animated objects then attack whomever or
whatever the caster designates. This spell cannot animate
objects carried or worn by a creature. An animated object can
be of any non-magical material. The caster can animate one
object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level
(i.e. 300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so
on).

The GM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in
combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same
attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no
more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier
objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM's discretion). As a special
case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die
roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated
objects have a movement rate of 10', and generally must move in
contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or
bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM).

Anti-Magic Shell  Range:  10' radius

Magic-User 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

Within a 10' radius around the caster, all magic is negated for
the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect
the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are
suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until
the spell has expired.

Blade Barrier  Range:  90'

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell creates a wall of whirling blades up to 20' long per
caster level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius
of up to 5' per two levels. Either form will be up to 20 ft.
high (as allowed by available space). Any creature passing
through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level
(maximum 15d6), with a save vs. Death Ray reducing damage to
half.

If the caster evokes the barrier so that it appears where
creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through
the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on
the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a
successful save vs. Death Ray.

A blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) against
attacks made through it.

Bless*  Range:  50' radius

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 minute/level

This spell gives the caster and his or her allies (within a 50'
radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 on attack rolls, morale
checks (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and
saving throws against magical fear.

The reverse of bless is called bane. It fills the caster's
enemies (within a 50' radius) with fear and doubt, causing each
affected creature to suffer a –1 penalty on attack rolls, morale
checks, and saving throws against magical fear.

Charm Animal  Range:  60'

Cleric 2  Duration:  level+1d4 rounds

This spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in
much the same fashion as charm person, at a rate of 1 hit die
per caster level. The caster may decide which individual
animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess
hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed,
either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more
fantastic nature (as determined by the GM) are allowed a save
vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals
will resume normal activity immediately.

This spell does not grant the caster any special means of
communication with the affected animals; if combined with speak
with animals, this spell becomes significantly more useful.

Charm Monster  Range:  30'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  special

This spell functions like charm person, except that the effect
is not restricted by creature type or size. Undead monsters are
unaffected. This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice of creatures of 3
or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more than 3 hit dice.
Saving throws are made just as for charm person.

Charm Person  Range:  30'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less
regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and
demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of ability. A
save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If the creature is
currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or
her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The
spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person
as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her
words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try
to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it
wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional
saving throw to overcome the magic (at the GM's discretion).
The caster must speak the target's language to communicate any
commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the
caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect
its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the caster's
enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a “safe”
place). The target receives a new saving throw each day if it
is has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its
Intelligence is 9-12, or every month it its Intelligence is 8
or less.

Clairvoyance  Range:  60'

Magic-User 3  Duration:  12 turns

This spell enables the caster to see into another area through
the eyes of a living creature in that area. The caster must
specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum
of 60' away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area,
the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target
creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may
choose another subject creature after at least a turn has
passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the
subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though
the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.

Cloudkill  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 5  Duration:   6 rounds/level

This spell creates a 20'x20'x20' cloud of poison gas which moves
at a rate of 10' per round under the control of the caster (so
long as he or she concentrates on it). The gas kills outright
any creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it comes in
contact with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice or levels
must save vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists for the entire
duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.

Commune  Range:  self

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or
an extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no
question per caster level. The ritual to cast this spell takes
1 turn to complete. The being contacted may or may not be
omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied
with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or
completely. These details are left to the GM's discretion.

Confusion  Range:  360'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  2 rounds+1/level

This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30' radius
circle around the target point to become confused, making them
unable to independently determine what they will do. A saving
throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the
following table on each subject’s Initiative number each round
to see what the subject does.

d20

Behavior

1–2

Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster
if attack is not possible).

3–4

Act normally.

5–10

Do nothing but babble incoherently.

11–14

Flee away from caster at top possible speed.

15–20

Attack nearest creature.

A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action
does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any
special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any
confused character who is attacked automatically retaliates on
its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn
comes.

Conjure Elemental  Range:  240'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or
Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental
from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be
summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental
appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the
caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature;
spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate
results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in
control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at
will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the
Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned
Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then
seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only
dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the elemental once
control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to
return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not
choose to remain on the material plane for long.

Continual Light*  Range:  360'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 year/level

This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as
full daylight up to a 30' radius, with light of lesser
intensity to a radius of 60'. Continual light can be cast on an
object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the light
spell, up to a maximum range of 360' from the caster. The spell
remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.

As with light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if
cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are
allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is
cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of
-4 is applied to the blinded creature's attack rolls if the
saving throw fails.

The reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence
of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light
sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind just as
continual light may.

Create Food  Range:  10'

Cleric 5  Duration:  permanent

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of the caster's
choice, highly nourishing, but rather bland. Up to 3 men or one
horse per caster level can be fed for one day with this spell.
Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours,
although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting
purify food and water on it.

Create Water  Range:  10'

Cleric 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell creates one gallon of water per caster level. Note
that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available
at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just
like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per
gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.

Cure Blindness  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  instantaneous

With this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering
blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including
light or continual light). Blindness caused by a curse cannot
be cured by this spell.

Cure Disease*  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  instantaneous

Cure disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering
from. The spell also kills parasites afflicting the target
creature. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this
spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or
higher.

Note: This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new
exposure to the same disease.

Cure Light Wounds*  Range:  touch

Cleric 1  Duration:  instantaneous

With this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 hit points of damage by
laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.

The reverse form of this spell, cause light wounds, causes 1d6+1
damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll
is required in this case.

Undead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite
fashion; they are injured by cure light wounds and healed by
cause light wounds.

Cure Serious Wounds*

Cleric 4  Range:  touch

Duration:  instantaneous

This spell works exactly like cure light wounds, save that it
heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The
reverse, cause serious wounds, also works exactly like cause
light wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in
damage.

Darkvision  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 hour/level

The subject receives Darkvision with a range of 60' for the
duration of the spell. (See page 37 for details.)

Death Spell  Range:  240'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a
30' radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within
the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each
creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that
fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more hit dice
or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters,
golems, and any other “creature” that is not truly alive.

Detect Evil*  Range:  60'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the
caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items
with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of
evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot
be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is
detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects
with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen
by anyone else.

The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note
that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,”
and thus not detectable by this spell.

Reversed, this spell becomes detect good, which works just as
described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments,
angelic creatures, and so on.

Detect Invisible  Range:  60'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

By means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible
characters, creatures or objects within the given range, seeing
them as translucent shapes.

Detect Magic  Range:  60'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  2 turns

The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or
enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight,
seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster
sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected
by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic
will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the
caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack
penalty of only -2.

Dimension Door  Range:  10'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  instantaneous

The caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself,
or any single target creature within range, to any spot within
200' plus 20' per caster level. The caster or target creature
always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster
visualizes the area or states direction and distance. An
unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being
transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target
creature will be transported also, including another character
or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area
is within a solid object, the spell fails automatically.

Disintegrate  Range:  60'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell causes a thin, green ray to spring from the caster's
pointing finger. Any single creature or object (up to a
10x10x10 foot cube of material) is entirely disintegrated,
leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated
creature’s equipment is unaffected.

A creature that makes a successful save vs. Spells is
unaffected. The ray can target only one creature per casting,
if that target saves, the spell is wasted.

Dispel Evil  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures
from the nether planes, hereafter called “evil creatures.”

First, the caster gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against
attacks by evil creatures.

Second, the caster can choose to drive an evil creature back to
its home plane by touch (requiring a successful attack roll).
The creature can negate the effects with a successful save vs.
Spells. This use discharges and ends the spell.

Third, with a touch the caster can automatically dispel any one
spell cast by an evil creature. Exception: Spells that can’t be
dispelled by dispel magic also can’t be dispelled by dispel
evil. Saving throws do not apply to this effect. This use
discharges and ends the spell.

The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide;
however, extraplanar creatures that oppose the caster should
almost always qualify.

Dispel Magic  Range:  120'

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have
been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or
at least their effects) within a cubic area 20' on a side. The
caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or
object, or to affect an area.

If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects
(including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast
upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled.
Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than
the dispel magic caster's level is ended automatically. Those
created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is
a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell
effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level
caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a
20% chance of failure.

Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically
includes any curse, including those created by bestow curse
(the reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.

ESP  Range:  60'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell permits the caster to detect the surface thoughts of
one or more targets within range. The caster must designate a
direction, and then concentrate for a turn in order to “hear”
the thoughts. Each turn the caster may choose to “listen” in a
different direction. The caster may stop listening, then resume
again later, so long as the duration has not expired. The target
creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way.

Rock more than 2 inches thick or a thin coating of lead or gold
will block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this
effect, as are mindless creatures such as golems.

Feeblemind  Range:  180'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  permanent

If the target creature fails a saving throw vs. Spells, its
Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected
creature is unable to cast spells, understand language, or
communicate coherently. The victim does remember who its
friends are and can follow and protect them from harm. The
subject remains in this state until a heal spell is used to
cancel the effect. A target creature that can cast Magic-User
spells suffers a penalty of -4 on its saving throw against this
spell.

Find Traps  Range:  30'

Cleric 2  Duration:  3 turns

This spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both
mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30’ of a
trap, he or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue
aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain
natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls
of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with
the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about
its type or nature.

Find the Path  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a specified destination. The caster must have
some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has
ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described
to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a
name) is enough for this spell to function.

The locale can be outdoors or underground. Find the path works
with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The
location must be on the same plane as the caster at the time of
casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction
that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at
appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions
to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect
secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends
when the destination is reached or the duration expires,
whichever comes first.

Fireball  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

A fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates
with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster
level to every creature within a spherical volume having a 20'
radius. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The
explosion creates almost no pressure.

The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance
and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing,
pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it
impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to
attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at
that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.)
If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow
passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a
missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit the opening,
or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as
lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to
an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
fireball may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its
full volume.

Flesh to Stone*  Range:  30'/level

Magic-User 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes the subject, along with all its carried gear,
to turn into a mindless, inert statue. A saving throw vs.
Petrification is allowed to resist the spell. If the statue
resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if
ever returned to its original state) suffers equivalent damage
or deformities. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by
this spell.

The reverse spell, stone to flesh, acts as a counterspell for
flesh to stone, restoring the creature just as it was when it
was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone that is not
the result of flesh to stone or similar petrification effects
(such as a medusa's gaze).

Floating Disc  Range:  0

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 turns +1/level

This spell creates an invisible, slightly concave circular plane
of force for carrying loads. It is about the size of a shield,
being 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can
hold a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs
about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must be loaded so that the
items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of
course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over
62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other
reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc.
Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide
about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes;
but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain
stable.

The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the
caster's waist. It remains still when within 10' of the caster,
and follows at the caster's movement rate if he or she moves
away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to
position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than
10' from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc
disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to
the surface beneath.

Fly  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 turn/level

The subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her
normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The
subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed,
with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on
the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only
as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or
cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither
charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her
maximum load.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still
aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 120'
per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in
that amount of time, he or she lands safely. If not, the
subject falls the rest of the distance, taking normal falling
damage. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the
subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is
dispelled.

Geas*  Range:  5' per level

Magic-User 6  Duration:  special

Geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some
service or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to
understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a
geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts
that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to
resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may
choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with
the caster to perform some service.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the
geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the
spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster
level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas
(or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a –2 penalty to
each of its ability scores, up to a total of –8. No ability
score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability
score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes
obeying the geas.

A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse
spell, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel
magic does not affect a geas.

Growth of Animals  Range:  60'+10'/level

Cleric 3  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and
eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do
double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its
existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal's
carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save
vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals
will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused
or panicky afterward (at the GM's discretion).

All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged
by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical
properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves
the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its
normal size.

The spell gives no means of command or influence over the
enlarged animals.

Growth of Plants*  Range:  120'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes,
creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become
thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are
determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a
10'x100' area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants
entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or
force a way through. All movement within the affected area is
reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized
creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal
movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for
this spell to take effect.

The reverse form, shrink plants, may be used to render overgrown
areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal
version.

Growth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered,
either by the opposite form or by dispel magic. This spell has
no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.

Hallucinatory Terrain  Range:  400'+40'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  12 turns/level

This spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain
appear like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland
into desert, or the like). This spell requires a full turn to
cast.

The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort
of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within
the area are not hidden or changed in appearance. A save vs.
Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the
creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so.

Haste*  Range:  30'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster
level. The affected creatures move and act twice as quickly as
normal, having double their normal movement rates and making
twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the
spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic
items such as wands, which may still be used just once per
round. Multiple haste or speed effects don’t combine; only
apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

Reversed, haste becomes slow; affected creatures move at half
speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round)
and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target
creatures may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and
slow counter and dispel each other.

Heal*  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

Heal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It
immediately ends any and all of the following adverse
conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness,
confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue,
feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all
but 1d4 of the target's hit points. Heal does not remove
negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score
points.

The reversed spell, harm, injures the creature touched so
horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster
must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure
means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer
hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will
take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in
which harm may kill a creature).

Generally, both heal and harm only affect living creatures. If
used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm;
likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as
golems are unaffected by either spell.

Hold Monster  Range:  180'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  2d8 turns

This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects
any living creature that fails its save vs. Spells.

Hold Person  Range:  180'

Cleric 2, Magic-User 3  Duration:  2d8 turns

This spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human
or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will
not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware,
and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including
speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect.
The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her
save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures
in the group may be affected.

A winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and
falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can’t
swim and may drown.

Hold Portal  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter
of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as
if it were securely closed and normally locked. A knock spell
or a successful dispel magic spell can negate a hold portal
spell.

Ice Storm  Range:  300'+30'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 round

This spell causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1
full round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a
20' radius around the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells
will reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical
volume of 40', so creatures higher than that distance above the
target spot are unaffected. A –20% penalty applies to each
Listen roll made within the ice storm’s effect, and all land
movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the
duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other
than the damage dealt). Any creature naturally resistant to
cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its
save).

Insect Plague  Range:  300'+30'/level

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels,
to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level. See Insect Swarm in
the Monsters section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms
must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one
other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous
area). The caster may summon the locust swarms so that they
share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any
creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after
being summoned.

Invisibility  Range:  touch

Magic-User 2  Duration:  special

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from
sight, including Darkvision. If the recipient is a creature
carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If the spell is cast on
someone else, neither the caster nor his or her allies can see
the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or
employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become
visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing
or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes
invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the
effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of
an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10
feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not
magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the
recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts any
spell. Actions (other than spellcasting) directed at unattended
objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not
an attack. The spell lasts at most 24 hours.

Invisibility 10' Radius  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell
confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the
recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the
recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves
as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out
of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area
after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected
creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the
invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient
attacks, the invisibility sphere ends for all affected
creatures.

Invisible Stalker  Range:  0

Magic-User 6  Duration:  special

The caster summons an invisible stalker to do his or her bidding
(see the Monsters section, below, for details). The spell
persists until dispel evil is cast on the creature, it is
slain, or the task is fulfilled. The GM is advised to review
the monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is
used, as they may not always be reliable servants.

Knock  Range:  30'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  special

The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard
locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or
trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles,
or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can
be opened). If used to open a wizard locked door, the spell
does not remove the wizard lock but simply suspends its
functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not
relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not
raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor
will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can undo
a single means of preventing access.

Levitate  Range:  touch

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

Levitate allows the caster to move himself or herself, another
creature, or an object up and down as desired. A creature must
be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or
possessed by a willing creature. The caster can mentally direct
the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round,
by concentration. The caster cannot move the recipient
horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of
a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move
laterally (generally at half its normal land speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a weapon finds itself
increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 attack
penalty, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5.
A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin
again at –1.

Light*  Range:  120'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  6 + level turns

This spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates
a 30' radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20')
around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if
cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.
Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.

Reversed, light becomes darkness, creating an area of darkness
just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision
and negates mundane light sources.

A light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness
spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing
so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing
ambient light level.

Either version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by
means of casting it on the target's ocular organs. The target is
allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if
the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A light
or darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of
effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the
victim).

Lightning Bolt  Range:  50'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that
deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level to each
creature within its area. A save vs. Spells for half damage is
allowed. The bolt begins at the caster's fingertips and extends
to the range given. The caster may choose to limit the range of
the spell, but the minimum range is 60 feet. The lightning bolt
passes through an area 5' wide, arcing and jumping, so that,
while it is not actually 5' wide, for game purposes treat it as
if it is so.

The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects
in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such
as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused
to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range
permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward
the caster, or in a random direction at the GM's option.
Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take
additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.

Locate Object  Range:  360'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a
well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search
for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is
located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot
specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that
particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell
is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures
cannot be found by this spell.

Lower Water  Range:  360'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by
as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1
inch). The water is lowered within a more or less square-shaped
depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level.
In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep
ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and
similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them
unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the
spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based
creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (the reverse of
haste); a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the
effect. The spell has no effect on other creatures.

Magic Jar  Range:  60'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

By casting magic jar, the caster places his or her soul in a gem
or large crystal within spell range (known as the magic jar),
leaving the body lifeless. The caster may then attempt to take
control of a nearby living creature within spell range, forcing
its soul into the magic jar. The caster may move back to the jar
(thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to
possess another body. The spell ends when the caster's soul
returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty.

To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and
the caster must know where it is, though he or she does not
need to be able to see it. When the caster transfers his or her
soul upon casting, the caster's body is, as near as anyone can
tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body
would.

Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by
protection from evil or a similar ward. The subject is allowed
a save vs. Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host
leaves the caster's life force in the magic jar, and that
target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration
of the spell.

If the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the
host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic
jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities
(including spellcasting ability). The body retains its
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural
abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to
make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access
to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body.

If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is
broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage): If the jar
is in range of the caster's body, the caster's spirit returns to
its body. Otherwise, the caster's spirit departs (the caster
dies). In either case, the spell ends.

If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by dispel
evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the
caster's spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit
returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the
same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the
magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit
departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar (and departs),
and the host's body dies.

If the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken:
If the jar is in range of the host's body, the caster's spirit
departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell
ends. Otherwise, the host's spirit departs, and the caster's
spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell
has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the
caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending
the spell.

In any case where the spell ends with the caster's body
unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.

Magic Missile  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 1  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from
the caster's fingertip and strike its target, dealing 1d6+1
points of damage. The missile strikes unerringly, even if the
target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total
concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out.
Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every three caster levels beyond 1st, an additional missile
is fired – two at 4th level, three at 7th, four at 10th, and
the maximum of five missiles at 13th level or higher. If the
caster fires multiple missiles, he or she can target a single
creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only
one creature. Targets must be designated before damage is
rolled.

Magic Mouth  Range:  30'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted
mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time
a specified event occurs. The message, which may be up to three
words per caster level long, can be in any language known by
the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at
any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the
caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use
command words or activate magical effects. It does, however,
move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon
a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to
speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock,
or any other object.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled
according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands
can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only
visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what
appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them.
Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical
darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical
silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed
to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken
word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or
audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or
class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a
6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to
triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth
can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in
line of sight or within hearing distance.

Massmorph  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 hour/level

With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller)
creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are
natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest,
stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern,
etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120'
radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those
creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only
if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include
himself or herself among the affected creatures.

Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing
through the area for so long as they remain still. If an
affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is
dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still
continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he
or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also
be ended by dispel magic.

Mirror Image  Range:  self

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster.
The images move through each other as well as the real caster
more or less constantly, making it impossible for most
creatures to determine which is real. A total of 1d4 images
plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images
total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and
remain in a cluster around him or her. The figments mimic the
caster's actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions,
levitate, and so on, just as the caster does. Figments always
look exactly like the caster.

Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will
always hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image
destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not;
likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will
destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells
are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect
all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance,
if the caster is subjected to a fireball, all figments will
appear to be injured just as the caster was.

Neutralize Poison*  Range:  touch

Cleric 4  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or
object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional
effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by
poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1
hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.)
the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes poison. The caster must make a
successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target
must save vs. Poison or die. The caster's touch remains
poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged
(i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

Passwall  Range:  30'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  3 turns

Passwall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone
walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The
passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep
per three caster levels above 9th (20 feet at 12th, 30 feet
deep at 15th, 40 feet deep at 18th). If the wall’s thickness is
more than the depth of the passage created, then a single
passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall
spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick
walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, dispel magic, or
caster's choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out
the nearest exit.

Phantasmal Force  Range:  180'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  concentration

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature,
or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of
20'x20'x20'. The illusion does not create sound, smell,
texture, or temperature. The caster can move the image within
the limits of the size of the effect. The image persists so
long as the caster concentrates upon it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they
will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in
combat. If used to simulate an attack spell, a successful save
vs. Spells will allow victims to avoid all damage. Damage done
by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real;
those “killed” or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up
uninjured (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The
illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage
for any attack form simulated.

Polymorph Other  Range:  30'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell allows the caster to change one target into another
form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit
dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike
polymorph self, the transformed target also gains the
behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special,
supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in
addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such.
If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target
may not remember its former life.

The target creature will have the same number of hit points it
previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as
noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a
doppleganger can revert to its natural form in one round.

Unwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are
not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the
creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or
her original form.

Polymorph Self  Range:  self

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to change into another form of
living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than
the caster's level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or
gaseous form. If slain, the caster reverts to his or her
original form.

The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the
new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she
also gains all physical attacks possessed by the form but does
not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities.
Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the
caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she could use the
dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the
dragon's breath.

The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of
ability, or may choose to end the spell whenever he or she
desires (up to one hour per level, of course).

Projected Image  Range:  240'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  6 turns

This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster.
The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like
the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions
(including speech). Any further spells cast seem to originate
from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight
between the caster and his or her illusory self must be
maintained or the spell ends. Dimension door, teleport, or any
similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image,
as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note
that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster;
for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able
to see something the caster can't directly see, the caster does
not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the
caster's actual position, not the illusory self's position.

Protection from Evil*  Range:  touch

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from
mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a
magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The
barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on
saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects
created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is
left to the individual GM to decide.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded
creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise
mental control over the creature (including charm spells or
effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from
targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect
for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the
protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting
control does, the would-be controller would then be able to
command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps
out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in
place before the spell is cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures
(regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the
natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the
creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded
creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures
ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to
force the barrier against the blocked creature.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions
in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are
kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.

Protection from Evil 10' Radius*

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3  Range:  touch

Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell functions exactly as protection from evil, but with a
10' radius rather than a 1' radius. All within the radius
receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or
who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as
well.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good 10' radius,
and functions exactly as the reversed form of protection from
evil, except that it covers a 10' radius around the target
rather than the normal 1' radius.

Protection from Normal Missiles

Magic-User 3  Range:  self

Duration:  1 turn/level

The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical
missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or
other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows,
sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be
fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows
count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.

Purify Food and Water

Cleric 1  Range:  10'

Duration:  instantaneous

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise
contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and
drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay
or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of
significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell
has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.

Quest*  Range:  5'/level

Cleric 5  Duration:  special

Quest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some
service or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to
understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a
quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts
that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to
resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may
choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with
the caster to perform some service.

The affected creature must follow the given instructions until
the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell
remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A
clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours,
it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.

A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse
spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of
the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel
magic does not affect a quest spell.

Raise Dead*  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or
humanoid. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead
for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the
subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the
subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not
work.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell
loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently
(i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an
actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience
points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st
level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would
reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This
level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any
means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit
dice in the normal fashion.

Also note, a character who died with spells prepared has none
prepared upon being raised.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its
current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in
the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and
curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and
repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to
be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still
missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the
dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any
way by this spell.

A creature which has become undead can’t be raised by this
spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell
cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

The reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the
creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human,
demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If
the saving throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the
victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell
in combat.

Read Languages  Range:  0

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any
written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:

In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any
number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode
lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one
book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.

In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one
scroll (other than a spell scroll; for instance, a protection
scroll or a treasure map); this mode is permanent.

The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in
any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts
the caster doesn't otherwise have the ability to understand.
Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one
living creature that can read the given language somewhere on
the same plane.

Regenerate  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers,
toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of
multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow
back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is
complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and
touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for
the regeneration to complete.

This spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no
effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).

Reincarnate  Range:  touch

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

With this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or
humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death
occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell
and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the
subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not
work.

Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature
the character becomes:

d%

Incarnation

01–02

Bugbear

03–17

Dwarf

18–28

Elf

29

Gnoll

30–39

Gnome

40–44

Goblin

45–63

Halfling

64–88

Human

89–92

Kobold

93

Lizard Man

94–98

Orc

99

Troglodyte

100

Other (GM's choice)

Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all
physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of
the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of
the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but
the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the
character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell
creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to
inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes
one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is
reincarnated.

A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life
and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's
ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new
form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.)
The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a
real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to
magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total
from the character's original hit point total; this is the new
form's hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a
hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by
2.

A character that has been turned into an undead creature or
killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this
spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be
reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has
died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with
its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural
armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like,
but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new
form.

Remove Curse*  Range:  30'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 4  Duration:  instantaneous

Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or
a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a
cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell
typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed
item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may
not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a
caster of a certain level or higher.

The reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to
place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to
resist. The caster must choose one of the following three
effects:

–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).

–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.

Each round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act
normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

The caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should
be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus
bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a
remove curse spell.

Remove Fear*  Range:  touch (120')

Cleric 1  Duration:  instantaneous

(2 turns)

This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target
creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it
is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a
bonus of +1 per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, cause fear, causes one target
creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails
to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or
more hit dice are immune to this effect.

Resist Cold  Range:  touch

Cleric 1  Duration:  1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold.
Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate
clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more
significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the
affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all
damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).

Resist Fire  Range:  touch

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and
heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is
ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat
or fire (such as a fireball), the affected creature gains a
bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks
is reduced by half (round up).

Restoration  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell restores negative levels to a creature who has
suffered energy drain. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the
Encounter section) for details.

Restoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as
described for the spell raise dead).

Shield  Range:  self

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 rounds+1/level

Shield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force
that hovers in front of the caster. It negates magic missile
attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster's Armor
Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The
Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from
behind the caster, but magic missiles are warded off from all
directions.

Silence 15' Radius  Range:  360'

Cleric 2  Duration:  2 rounds/level

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within
a 15' radius around the target. All sound is stopped:
Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise
whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The
spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect
stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can
be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the
creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a
save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another
creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives
a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense
against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.

Sleep  Range:  90'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 rounds/level

This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a
magical slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not
affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell
(within the given range, of course), and those creatures within
30' of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the
area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the
effect.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an
affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not
affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures,
and such creatures in the area of effect are ignored.

When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake
up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and
the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue
sleeping normally, at the GM's option.

Speak with Animals  Range:  special

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 turn/4 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal
(normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is
in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster
may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will,
once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction
or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should
be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals
are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones
make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward
the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.

Speak with Monsters  Range:  special

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 turn/5 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster
that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The
caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at
will, once per round. Others able to understand the language
spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to
understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s
reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more
intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while
less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is
friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or
service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and
undead are unaffected by this spell.

Speak with Plants  Range:  20'

Cleric 4  Duration:  1 turn

The caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal
plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its
surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or
recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer
questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The
spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards
the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate
freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance
to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse
and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other
monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it
may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal
plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally
perform “services” other than to answer questions.

Speak with Dead  Range:  10'

Cleric 3  Duration:  3 rounds/level

This spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a
corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster
puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster
levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires.
The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew
during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers
are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the
past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell
on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but
the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged
corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct
answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at
all.

This spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person
(whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted
knowledge “stored” in the corpse. The partially animated body
retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and
thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had
while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information.
Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned.

This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an
undead creature.

Spiritual Hammer  Range:  30'

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into
existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range
once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike,
+1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the
caster’s normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and
thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by
magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the
Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it,
the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed
by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod
of cancellation will dispel it.

Sticks to Snakes  Range:  120'

Cleric 4  Duration:  6 turns

This spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice
worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster
levels. (See the Monsters section for details on types of
snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When
slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to
their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted
staves cannot be affected.

Striking  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6
points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on
each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It
provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the
spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be
affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such
a monster, however.

Telekinesis  Range:  self

Magic-User 5  Duration:  3 turns

This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by
concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds
per caster level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A
creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds
or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray. In
order to use this power, the caster must maintain
concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no
running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If
concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power
may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the
effect is allowed a new saving throw.

Teleport  Range:  self

Magic-User 5  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell instantly transports the caster to a designated
destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster
level. Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring
along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100
pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with
all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although
creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another,
with at least one of those creatures in contact with the
caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs.
Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an
attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a
creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession
from being teleported.

The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout
of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more
likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong
magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even
impossible.

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the
table below. Refer to the following information for definitions
of the terms on the table.

Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has
been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a
place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be
seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as
scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one
hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more
than once but with which he or she is not very familiar.
“Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once,
possibly using magic.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if
the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that
no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to
no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.

On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.

Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away
from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target
is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The
direction off target is determined randomly.

Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that’s visually or
thematically similar to the target area. This means that the
caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no
such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply
fails instead.

Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster
have gotten “scrambled.” Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then
reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these
rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the
characters take more damage and must reroll.

True Seeing  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things
as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and
magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact
locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through
normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or
objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true
form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range
of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.

True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no
way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate
concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In
addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with
known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal
ball or in conjunction with clairvoyance.

Ventriloquism  Range:  60'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell allows the caster to cause his or her voice to sound
from someplace else within range, for example, from a dark
alcove or statue.

Wall of Fire  Range:  180'

Cleric 5, Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 round/level

(or special)

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs
into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster,
sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to
creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those
beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage
when it appears and on the caster's turn each round to all
creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points
+1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature
passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead
creatures.

The wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20' in length per
caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5' per caster
level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if
desired. The wall may be up to 20' tall (as desired by the
caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).

If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures
are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall;
a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that
damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10' of the wall.

The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within
reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it
with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her
option.

Wall of Iron  Range:  90'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into
being. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square
section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so
desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding
nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall
cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a
creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat
plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available
space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the
ground.

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a
proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the
thickness halved the area. The wall may not be made less than
one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically
resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so
that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures
beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction
if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction
rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13
Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or
several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional
Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is
sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the
falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray
(with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or
smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The
wall cannot crush larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation,
and other natural phenomena.

Wall of Stone  Range:  15' per level

Magic-User 5  Duration:  permanent

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining
rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square
section, 1' thick, per caster level. The caster can double the
wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be
conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
another object.

The caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he or
she desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest
upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be
solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a
chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is
more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This
requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. The wall can be
crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so
forth by likewise reducing the area.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and
chipping.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within
or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can
hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with
successful saves vs. Death Ray.

Water Breathing  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  2 hours/level

The affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the
duration evenly among all the creatures the caster touches. The
spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.

Web  Range:  10' per level

Magic-User 2  Duration:  2 turns/level

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands,
filling a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight
10'x10'x10' cubes). The strands are similar to spider webs but
far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or
more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web
collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation,
the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes,
up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume.
The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she
wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among
the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the
attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected
area will.

Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a
save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is
entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is
reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled
creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks;
whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide.
Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web,
it will be able to act normally again.

If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or
perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible,
however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more
hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such
creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as
given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having
Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped
until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the
webs alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will
spread to adjacent 10' cubes each round until all the webbing
is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All
creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage
from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free
afterwards.

Wizard Eye  Range:  240'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  6 turns

With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical “eye”
through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but
otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created
in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240' away,
and thereafter can move at a rate of 40' per round as directed
by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240' feet away
from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass
through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a
normal human's eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1
inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.

Wizard Lock  Range:  20'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  permanent

A wizard lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically
locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own wizard lock
without affecting it, as can any Magic-User 3 or more levels
higher than the caster of the wizard lock; otherwise, a door or
object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in
or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell.

Word of Recall  Range:  self (special)

Cleric 6  Duration:  instantaneous

Word of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her
sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must
designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and
it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival
is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The
caster can be transported any distance within a plane but
cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along
objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds
per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all
objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures
to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at
least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).

An unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall.
Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its
possession from being teleported.

PART 4: THE ADVENTURE

Time and Scale

Time in the dungeon is measured in game turns, which are
(approximately) 10 minutes long. When combat begins, the time
scale changes to combat rounds, which are (approximately) 10
seconds long. Thus, there are 60 combat rounds per game turn.

Distances in the dungeon are measured in feet. Outdoors, change
all distance measurements (movement, range, etc.) to yards (so
100' becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for
spells, for instance) normally remain in feet.

Dungeon Adventures

Carrying Capacity

Normal Human, Elven and Dwarvish player characters are able to
carry up to 60 pounds and still be considered lightly loaded,
or up to 150 pounds and be considered heavily loaded. Halflings
may carry up to 50 pounds and be considered lightly loaded, or
up to 100 pounds and be heavily loaded. Note that armor for
Halfling characters is about one-quarter as heavy as armor for
the other races.

These figures are affected by Strength; each +1 of Strength
bonus adds 10% to the capacity of the character, while each -1
deducts 20%. Thus, carrying capacities for normal characters
are as shown below (rounded to the nearest 5 pounds for
convenience):

Dwarf, Elf, Human

The carrying capacities of various domesticated animals are

animal.

Movement and Encumbrance

The movement rate of a character or creature is expressed as the
number of feet it can move per combat round. The normal player
character races can all move 40' per round. When exploring a
dungeon, time is expressed in turns, as explained above; normal
movement per turn is 3 times the movement rate per round.

This may seem slow, but this rate of movement includes such
things as drawing maps, watching out for traps and monsters
(though they may still surprise the party), etc. In a combat
situation, on the other hand, everyone is moving around
swiftly, and such things as drawing maps are not important.

A character's movement rate is adjusted by his or her
Encumbrance (the load he or she is carrying) as follows:

Armor Type

Lightly Loaded

Heavily Loaded

No Armor or Magic Leather

40'

30'

Leather Armor or Magic Metal

30'

20'

Metal Armor

20'

10'

Count the weight of armor worn when calculating encumbrance,
because armor counts both for bulk and restrictiveness as well
as for weight. Magic armor counts for its full weight but is
not as bulky and restrictive as normal armor, thus granting an
improved movement rate.

Mapping

In any dungeon expedition, making maps is important. Generally
one player will do this, drawing a map on graph paper as the
Game Master describes each room or corridor. Absolute accuracy
is usually not possible; the main thing is to ensure that the
party can find its way back out of the dungeon.

Light

A torch or lantern will provide light covering a 30' radius; dim
light will extend about 20' further. Normal torches burn for
1d4+4 turns, while a flask of oil in a lantern will burn for
18+1d6 turns. A candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with
dim light extending 5' further. In general, taper candles such
as are used for illumination will burn about 3 turns per inch
of height.

Darkvision

Some character races, and almost all monsters, have Darkvision.
This gives them the ability to see even in total darkness.
Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal
sight. Darkvision does not grant one the ability to see in
magical darkness. The range of Darkvision is typically either
30' or 60'; if not given for a particular creature, assume the
60' range.

Darkvision is totally ineffective in any light greater than
moonlight.

Doors

A stuck door can be opened on a roll of 1 on 1d6; add the
character's Strength bonus to the range, so that a character
with a bonus of +2 can open a stuck door on a roll of 1-3 on
1d6.

Locked doors can be forced by rolling the same range, but on
1d10. Metal bars can sometimes be bent on a roll of this range
on 1d20.

Traps

Dungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including
spear-throwers, covered pits, etc. The GM will decide what is
required to trigger a trap, and what happens when the trap is
triggered. In general, there must be some way to avoid or
reduce the effect of the trap being sprung. For instance, a
save vs. Death Ray is often used to avoid falling into a
covered pit (with Dexterity bonus added), while spear-throwers,
automated crossbows, and the like are sometimes treated as if
they were monsters (attacking vs. the victim's Armor Class at
some given attack bonus).

Normal characters have a chance equal to a roll of 1 on 1d6 to
detect a trap if a search for one is made. Note that this is
about a 16.7% chance; Thieves have a special ability to find
and remove traps, which supersedes this roll, as does the
stonework trap-finding ability of Dwarves. A Dwarven Thief is a
special case; apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher.
In all cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10'
square area. A single character may only effectively search a
given area for traps once, even if the character has more than
one trap-detection roll “type” allowed (such as the Dwarven
Thief above).

Trap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely magical
in nature; on the other hand, in such cases Magic-Users and/or
Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at the given 1 in
1d6 chance, at the Game Master's option.

Secret Doors

Under normal conditions, searching for secret doors takes one
turn per character per 10' of wall searched. A secret door is
found on a roll of 1 on 1d6; characters with 15 or higher
Intelligence succeed on a roll of 1-2. Also, as noted
previously, Elves add 1 to the range automatically, such that
an Elf discovers secret doors on a 1-2 on 1d6, or 1-3 if the
Elf has an Intelligence of 15 or higher. The GM may create
secret doors that are more difficult (or easier) to detect at
his or her option.

Multiple characters searching for secret doors ensures that any
such will eventually be found; however, if the first and second
searchers fail, the next searcher must take two turns to search,
and all subsequent searches of the area require an hour.

Note that finding a secret door does not grant understanding of
how it works. The GM may require additional rolls or other
actions to be taken before the door can be opened.

Dungeon Survival

As described in the Equipment section, above, normal characters
must consume one day's worth of rations (or equivalent food)
and a minimum of one quart of water per day.

Failure to consume enough food does not significantly affect a
character for the first two days, after which he or she loses 1
hit point per day. Furthermore, at that point the character
loses the ability to heal wounds normally, though magic will
still work. Eating enough food for a day (over the course of
about a day, not all at once) restores the ability to heal, and
the character will recover lost hit points at the normal rate.

Inadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a single
day without water, the character loses 1d4 hit points, and will
lose an additional 1d4 hit points per day thereafter; healing
ability is lost when the first die of damage is rolled.

Wilderness Adventures

Wilderness Movement Rates

Movement rates when traveling in the wilderness are related
directly to encounter movement rates, as shown on the table
below:

Encounter Movement

(Feet per Round)

Wilderness Movement

(Miles per Day)

Naturally, any group traveling together moves at the rate of the
slowest member.

Overland Travel

The movement rates shown on the table above are figured based on
an 8 hour day of travel through open, clear terrain. The terrain
type will alter the rate somewhat, as shown on this table:

Terrain

Adjustment

Jungle, Mountains, Swamp

x1/3

Desert, Forest, Hills

x1/2

Clear, Plains, Trail

x2/3

Road (Paved)

x1

Characters may choose to perform a forced march, traveling 12
hours per day. If this is done, add an additional 50% to the
distance traveled. Each day of forced march performed after the
first inflicts 1d6 damage on the characters (and their animals,
if any). A save vs. Death Ray with Constitution bonus applied
is allowed to avoid this damage, but after this save is failed
once, it is not rolled again for that character or creature. A
day spent resting “restarts” the progression.

Waterborne Travel

Travel by water may be done in a variety of boats or ships; see
the table in the Vehicles section for details. Travel distances
are based on a 12 hour day of travel, rather than the usual 8
hours per day given above. Note that sailed ships may travel 24
hours per day (if a qualified navigator is aboard), and so may
be able to cover twice the normal distance per day of travel.
This is in addition to the multiplier given below. If the ship
stops each night, as is done by some vessels traveling along a
coastline as well as those vessels having less than the minimum
number of regular crewmen on board, the two-times multiplier
does not apply.

Movement of sailed ships varies depending on weather conditions,
as shown on the following table. Sailing movement modifiers
shown apply when sailing with the wind; sailing against the
wind involves tacking (called “zigzagging” by landlubbers)
which reduces movement rates two rows on the table (from
Moderate Breeze to Very Light Breeze, for instance).

given rowing movement rate.

Very Strong Winds: Sailing against the wind (tacking) is not
possible.

Gale: Sailing against the wind is not possible, and ships
exposed to a gale may be damaged or sunk; apply 2d8 points of
damage to any such ship, per hour sailed.

Traveling by Air

When traveling by air, overland movement rates are doubled, and
all terrain effects are ignored. Most winged creatures must
maintain at least one-third normal forward movement in order to
remain airborne; however, devices such as flying carpets
generally do not have to do this.

Becoming Lost

Adventurers following roads, trails, rivers, streams, or other
obvious landmarks are unlikely to become lost; however, when
the party strikes out into trackless forest, windblown desert,
etc., they may become lost. Secretly roll a save vs. Death Ray,
adjusted by the Wisdom of the party leader (i.e., whichever
player character seems to be leading). (Alternately, an Ability
Roll against Wisdom may be rolled, if that optional rule is in
use.) The GM must determine the effects of a failed roll.

Retainers, Specialists and Mercenaries

Player characters will sometimes want or need to hire NPCs
(Non-Player Characters) to work for them. There are several
categories of NPCs available for hire, as follows:

Retainers

A retainer is a close associate of his employer. Retainers are
hired for a share of treasure (typically at least 15% of the
employer's income) plus support costs (weapons, armor, rations,
and basic equipment provided by the employer). Retainers are
typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks;
in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will
generally accompany a player character into a dungeon, lair, or
ruin.

Hiring a retainer is more involved than hiring other NPCs.
First, the player character must advertise for a retainer,
typically by hiring a crier, posting notices in public places,
or asking (and possibly paying) NPCs such as innkeepers or
taverners to direct potential retainers to the player
character. It is up to the Game Master to rule on what must be
done, and how successful these activities are.

If the player character is successful, one or more NPCs will
present themselves to be interviewed. The Game Master should
play out the interview with the player, and after all offers
have been made and all questions asked, a reaction roll should
be made. To check the potential retainer's reaction, the Game
Master rolls 2d6 and adds the player character's Charisma
bonus. In addition, the Game Master may apply any adjustments
he or she feels are appropriate (a bonus of +1 for
higher-than-average pay or the offer of a magic item such as a
sword +1, or a penalty if the player character offers poor
terms). The roll is read as follows:

Adjusted Die Roll

Result

2 or less

Refusal, -1 on further rolls

3-5

Refusal

6-8

Try again

9-11

Acceptance

12 or more

Acceptance, +1 to Loyalty

Refusal, -1 on further rolls means that all further reaction
rolls made toward that player character in the given town or
region will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by
the NPC to his fellows. If the player character tries again in
a different town, the penalty does not apply.

If a Try again result is rolled, the potential retainer is
reluctant, and needs more convincing; the player character must
“sweeten” the deal in order to get an additional roll, such as
by offering more pay, a magic item, etc. If the player character
makes no better offer, treat Try again as a Refusal result.

Loyalty: All retainers have a Loyalty score, which is generally
7 plus the employer's Charisma bonus (or penalty). The Loyalty
score is used just as the Morale score of monsters or
mercenaries is used.

If a Loyalty check roll made in combat is a natural 2, the
Loyalty of the retainer increases by +1 point. Note that a
Loyalty of 12 is fanatical… the retainer will do virtually
anything the player character asks, and never flee in combat.
However, the Game Master should still apply penalties when the
player character instructs the retainer to do something which
appears very risky, making a failed check possible.

In addition, the Game Master should roll a Loyalty check for
each retainer at the end of each adventure, after treasure is
divided, to determine if the retainer will remain with the
player character. The GM may apply adjustments to this roll,
probably no more than two points plus or minus, if the retainer
is particularly well or poorly paid.

Maximum Number of Retainers: A player character may hire at most
4 retainers, adjusted by the character's Charisma bonus or
penalty. Any attempts to hire more than this number of
retainers will be met with automatic refusals.

Level of Retainers: Normally, potential retainers will be
one-half the level of the employer (or less). So, a first level
character cannot hire retainers, second level PCs can only hire
first level characters, and so on. Of course, there is no way
for the retainers to directly know the level of the PC
employer, nor for the employer to know the level of the
potential retainer; but the Game Master should usually enforce
this rule for purposes of game balance. It shouldn't be
surprising that first level characters can't hire retainers, as
they have no reputation to speak of yet.

Experience for Retainers: Unlike other hired NPCs, retainers do
gain experience just as other adventurers do; however, as they
are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a
share of XP is allocated to each retainer. See Character
Advancement, below, for an example.

Specialists

Specialists are NPCs who may be hired by player characters to
perform various tasks. Specialists do not go on adventures or
otherwise risk their lives fighting monsters, disarming traps,
or any of the other dangerous things player characters and
retainers may do. Rather, specialists perform services the
player characters usually can't perform for themselves, like
designing and erecting castles, training animals, or operating
ships.

A player character is limited in the number of specialists he or
she can hire only by the amount of money they cost; Charisma
does not affect this.

Alchemist: 1,000 gp per month. These characters are generally
hired for one of two reasons: to make potions, or to assist a
Magic-User with magical research.

An alchemist can produce a potion, given the required materials
and a sample or a written formula for the potion, in the same
time and for the same cost as a Magic-User. They may also
research new potions, but at twice the cost in time and
materials as a Magic-User.

Alternately, a Magic-User seeking to create certain magic items
may employ an alchemist as an assistant. In this case, the
alchemist adds 15% to the Magic-User's chance of success.

Animal Trainer: 250 to 750 gp per month. Characters wishing to
ride hippogriffs or employ carnivorous apes as guards will need
the assistance of an animal trainer. The lowest cost above is
for an average animal trainer, able to train one type of
“normal” animal such as carnivorous apes; those able to train
more than one sort of animal, or to train monstrous creatures
such as hippogriffs, are more expensive to hire. The Game
Master must decide how long it takes to train an animal; in
some cases, animal training may take years, a fact the player
characters may find inconvenient as well as expensive. A single
animal trainer can train and manage no more than 5 animals at a
time, though in most cases once an animal is fully trained, if
it is put into service right away the animal trainer won't be
needed to handle it any longer.

Armorer (or Weaponsmith): 100 to 500 gp per month. Characters
hiring mercenaries, or having armed and armored followers to
take care of, will need the services of an armorer. In general,
for every 50 Fighters employed, one armorer is required to care
for their gear. The armorer's equipment is not included in the
costs given above, but the cost to maintain his apprentices is
included; most such characters will have 1d4 apprentices
assisting.

Higher priced armorers or weaponsmiths may be hired to assist in
making magic weapons or armor; in this case, the character hired
will be a specialist, an expert in making one particular type of
armor or weapon, and will command a higher price (as shown
above). Such characters will rarely agree to do the mundane
work of maintaining weapons and armor for a military unit.

Engineer: 750 gp per month. Any player character wishing to
build a fortress, a ship, or any other mundane construction
will need an engineer. Large projects may require several
engineers, at the GM's option.

Savant: 1,500 gp per month. Savants are experts in ancient and
obscure knowledge. Many savants have particular interests in
very limited or focused areas (for example, “Elven migrations
of the 2nd age”), but even these will know or have access to a
lot of facts. The listed cost is the minimum required to
maintain a savant with his library, collections, etc. If the
savant's patron asks a difficult question, there may be
additional costs for materials or research to answer it.

Ship's Crew: Special. A crew for a waterborne vessel involves
several types of characters. At the very least, a complement of
sailors and a Captain are needed; rowers will be needed aboard
galleys, and a Navigator is required aboard ships going out of
sight of land.

Costs per month for each sort of character are given below:

Seaman Type

Cost

Captain

300 gp

Navigator

200 gp

Sailor

10 gp

Rower

3 gp

In general, all such characters are normal men, and are not
armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or
shortswords. Player characters with appropriate backgrounds may
act as Captain, but unless experienced as a ship's captain, they
will have difficulty commanding respect from the regular sailors
(lower the Morale of such regular sailors by -2 if led by an
inexperienced Captain).

Mercenaries

Mercenaries are hired warriors. They are generally hired in
units as small as platoons: 32 to 48 Fighters, divided into two
to four squads of soldiers; each squad is led by a corporal,
while the platoon is led by a lieutenant plus a sergeant.
Platoons are joined together into companies, each generally
consisting of two to five platoons and led by a captain with a
sergeant as his assistant (called a first sergeant).

As mercenaries are almost always veteran troops, the average
mercenary is a 1st level Fighter; 10% of corporals and 50% of
sergeants are 2nd level. A mercenary lieutenant will generally
be 2nd level, while a captain will be 2nd to 4th level and his
first sergeant will be 2nd or 3rd level. Larger mercenary units
will usually be beyond the reach of player characters until they
have reached fairly high levels, and are left to the Game Master
to detail.

Mercenaries will virtually never go into a dungeon, lair, or
ruin, at least until it has been fully cleared. Rather, they
are used in outdoor military engagements; high level player
characters may hire mercenaries to defend or help defend their
castles or other holdings.

Mercenaries housed in a player character's stronghold require
200 square feet each but cost 25% less per month, as this is
covered by their room and board. (Elven mercenaries, however,
require 500 square feet of space each in order to reduce their
pay, as they demand better living conditions.) See the
Stronghold section for more details.

Statistics are given below for the most common sorts of
mercenaries; the statistics are for first level characters, and
should be adjusted when higher level characters are indicated
(as given above). In particular, multiply the given cost of
each mercenary by his or her level. Listed costs are in gold
pieces per month.

Character Advancement

Experience Points (XP)

Experience points are given for monsters defeated, and for other
challenges as the GM sees fit. The following table provides XP
values for monsters. Where a monster has both a character level
and hit dice given, use the larger value as the monster's level.
Non-combat challenges may be assigned a level, or a flat XP
value assigned, as the GM wishes.

If asterisks appear after the hit dice listing for a monster,
each asterisk adds the special ability bonus once; for example,
a creature with a hit dice figure of 2** is worth 125 XP.

For monsters with more than 19 hit dice, add 750 XP to the XP
Value and 25 XP to the Special Ability Bonus per additional hit
die.

After tallying the XP earned in a given adventure, the amount
should be divided by the number of adventurers. As described
above, each retainer should receive a one-half share; so a
group with four player characters and a retainer is counted as
having 4½ members. If 2,000 XP are earned by this group, one
share is 444 XP, and the retainer receives 222 XP.

No character may advance more than one level due to the
experience points from a single adventure. For example, Barthal
the Thief is 1st level and has 1,000 XP before going on an
adventure; during the adventure, he earns 2,000 more XP (an
amazing feat). This would make his total 3,000 XP, and he would
be a 3rd level Thief. This is not allowed; instead, he advances
to 2,499 XP, one short of the amount required for 3rd level,
and starts his next adventure at 2nd level.

PART 5: THE ENCOUNTER

I raised my shield to fend off one of the monsters, and hewed at
another with my sword, but I missed my first swing. Morningstar
swung at one of the monsters and struck it, but her sword did
the bony thing little harm. I saw that Apoqulis still stood by
the door; of Barthal there was no sign. Fortunately, Apoqulis
also had a torch.

Apoqulis raised his holy symbol and called in a loud voice, “In
the name of Tah, begone!” To my surprise, several of the
monsters turned as if afraid and ran out the door, disappearing
into the gloom. Unfortunately this left quite a few of them
still in the room.

Even as I saw all this I continued to hack at the monsters. It
took two good blows to down the first one; it appeared that
Morningstar was having similar trouble with the monsters. Then
one of the skeletons hit her, just a minor wound, but still I
felt good that I had invested my part of the proceeds of our
last excursion in a suit of plate mail armor; I was shrugging
off blows that would have harmed me were I still wearing chain
mail.

To my surprise, I saw Apoqulis down one of the monsters in a
single blow, then do the same to another in his very next
strike. His mace seemed to be much more effective against the
monsters than our swords. As I finally managed to down a second
skeleton, I heard a high-pitched yell… it was Barthal, a little
ways down the hallway, and he was throwing something.

There was a sound of glass breaking, and I felt a splash of
water on my face. Several of the skeletons began to smoke, and
then one of them fell in a heap. Holy water, I decided, but I
didn't have time to think about it. I just kept hacking at the
skeletons.

By the time they were all gone, I had taken a wound, and
Morningstar had taken a second. We had one potion of healing
left of those that Apoqulis' temple had given us; Morningstar
told me to drink it, but I could tell she was in worse shape
than I, so I insisted she take it.

Then we turned back to the sarcophagus…

Order of Play

When the party of adventurers comes in contact with potential
enemies, time shifts to combat rounds (10 seconds long, as
described previously). Before beginning combat, surprise is
checked (see below). Unsurprised characters then roll for
Initiative, and act in order of the rolls (again, as described
below).

Surprise

When surprise is possible, roll 1d6 for each side which might be
surprised; most normal characters are surprised on a roll of
1-2. Surprised characters are unable to act for one round.
Characters or creatures which are well hidden and prepared to
perform an ambush surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. Some
characters or creatures (such as Elves) are described as being
less likely to be surprised; reduce the range by 1 for such
creatures.

For example: Darion the Human Fighter and Morningstar the Elven
Fighter/Magic-User open a door and come face-to-face with a
party of goblins. The GM rolls 1d6 for the goblins; on a 1-2
they are all surprised. Then the GM rolls 1d6 for Darion and
Morningstar. If the roll is a 1, both of them are surprised; if
the roll is a 2, only Darion is surprised. If the roll is 3 or
more, neither of them are surprised.

Surprised characters or creatures stand flat-footed for one
round. They still defend themselves, so there is no penalty to
Armor Class, but they cannot move nor attack during the round
of surprise.

Monster Reactions

When a group of player characters meet one or more monsters,
it's important to know how the monsters will react to the
party. In many cases, the reaction of the monster or monsters
is obvious… zombies guarding a tomb will virtually always
attack intruders, for example.

In cases where the reaction of the monsters to the party is not
obvious, a reaction roll may be made. The Game Master rolls
2d6, adding the Charisma bonus of the “lead” character (or
applying his or her Charisma penalty) along with any other
adjustments he or she feels are reasonable, and consults the
table below:

Reaction Roll Table

Adjusted Die Roll

Result

2 or less

Immediate Attack

3-7

Unfavorable

8-11

Favorable

12 or more

Very Favorable

A result of 2 or less means that the player characters have so
offended the monsters that they attack immediately. An
Unfavorable result means that the monsters do not like the
player characters, and will attack if they may reasonably do
so. A Favorable result simply means that the monsters will
consider letting the player characters live if they choose to
parley; it does not necessarily mean that the monsters like the
player characters. A Very Favorable result means that the
monsters (or perhaps only the monster leader) do, in fact, like
the player characters; this does not mean that the monsters will
just hand over their treasure, but it does indicate that they
may choose to cooperate with the player characters in mutually
beneficial ways.

As always, interpreting the results of this roll is left to the
GM, who may choose to alter the result if he or she believes a
different result would be more enjoyable to play out than the
one rolled.

Initiative

Each round, 1d6 is rolled for Initiative for each character or
monster. This roll is adjusted by the character's Dexterity
bonus. High numbers act first. Any characters/monsters with
equal numbers act simultaneously. The GM may make single rolls
for groups of identical monsters at his or her option.

As the GM counts down the Initiative numbers, each character or
monster may act on his or her number. If desired, a combatant
can choose to wait until a later number to act. If a player
states that he or she is waiting for another character or
monster to act, then the player character's action takes place
on the same Initiative number as the creature he or she is
waiting for. In this case, the player character's action is
simultaneous with the creature waited for, just as if they had
rolled the same number.

A character using a weapon with a long reach (spears, for
instance) may choose to attack a closing opponent on the
closing opponent's number and thus attack simultaneously with
the opponent, even if the character rolled lower for
Initiative.

[-- Image: graphics13 --]Combat

Each character or creature involved in combat may move, if
desired, up to its encounter movement distance, and then
attack, if any opponent is in range, when its Initiative number
comes up. After attacking, a character or creature may not move
again until the next round.

Opponents more than 5' apart may move freely, but once two
opposing figures are within 5' of each other, they are
“engaged” and must abide by the rules under Defensive
Movement, below.

Running

Characters may choose to run; a running character is not
normally allowed to attack (but see Charging, below). Running
characters can move at double their normal encounter movement
rate. Characters are allowed to run a number of rounds equal to
2 times the character's Constitution, after which they are
exhausted and may only walk (at the normal encounter rate). For
monsters not having a given Constitution, allow the monster to
run for 24 rounds. Exhausted characters or creatures must rest
for at least a turn before running again.

Maneuverability

The following rules may be considered optional. They are hardly
needed for most dungeon adventures, but will add measurably to
combat situations in the wilderness, especially in waterborne
combat situations or when some or all combatants are flying.

Characters, creatures, and vehicles of various sorts have a
turning distance. This is given as a distance in feet in
parentheses after their movement rate, and it determines how
far they must move between facing changes when moving about in
combat.

All normal player characters, and in fact most moderately sized
creatures which walk on the ground, have a turning distance of
5'. If no turning distance is given for a creature, assume that
it is 5'.

In general, a facing change is any turn of up to 90º (a
right-angle turn); on a square-gridded map, this means turning
to face directly to the right or left of the figure's current
facing. A half-turn (45º) still counts as a full facing change.
If using hexes, “diagonal” movement is not available, so a
facing change is the 60º turn to face toward the hex-side to
the right or left of the current facing.

There are a few exceptions to this rule:

First, any creature that does not move away from its starting
position during the combat round may make as many facing
changes as desired (though circumstances, such as trying to
turn a horse around in a narrow corridor, may prevent this).

Incorporeal flying creatures, such as spectres, can turn freely
at any point while moving.

Creatures which are running (moving at double speed) may not
make facing changes of more than 60º, and their turning
distance increases by 10' (or, if it is 5' normally, it
increases to 10').

Also, most creatures can shift one space laterally while
preserving their facing (this is called “sidestepping”), but
this may only be done when moving at normal (“walking”) speed,
not at fast (“running”) speed. “One space” means either 5' or
10', depending on the map or board being used.

Climbing and Diving

For battles involving three dimensions, each creature or vehicle
has an altitude (when flying) or depth (underwater). For air or
sea battles, at least one of the creatures or vehicles should
start at an altitude/depth of 0, and a new 0 level can be
established at any time, to simplify play, by adjusting the
altitudes of each creature or vehicle.

A winged flier can gain up to 10' of altitude after moving
forward by the distance shown for its maneuverability class,
and can dive (lose altitude in a controlled fashion) at up to
twice the normal movement rate; if the creature does not move
horizontally by at least one-third its normal speed, it will
stall, being forced to dive at maximum rate for one round.
Floating creatures or vehicles (balloons, fly spell, flying
carpets, etc.) can climb vertically without horizontal motion
up to half the normal movement rate, but such “floaters” can
only descend at the normal movement rate, unless they have lost
the ability to float entirely.

Charging

Under some circumstances, characters or creatures may be allowed
to attack after a running move. This is called a charge, and
some specific limitations apply. First, the charging character
or creature must move at least 10 feet, and may move up to
double his or her normal movement rate, as given above. The
movement must be in a more or less straight line toward the
intended target, and the path to the target must be reasonably
clear. Finally, the attacker must be using a weapon such as a
spear, lance, or pole arm which is suitable for use while
charging. Certain monsters, especially including those with
horns, are able to use natural attacks when charging. If the
attacker does not have line of sight to the opponent at the
start of the charge, that opponent can’t be charged.

The attack made after the charge is made at +2 on the attack
roll. The charging character or creature takes a -2 penalty to
Armor Class for the remainder of the round. If the attack hits,
it does double damage.

Set Weapon Against Charge: Spears, pole arms, and certain other
piercing weapons deal double damage when “set” (braced against
the ground or floor) and used against a charging creature. For
this to be done, the character or creature being charged must
have equal or better Initiative; this counts as holding an
action: both attacker and defender act on the attacker's
Initiative number and are therefore simultaneous.

Evasion and Pursuit

Sometimes a party of adventurers will want nothing more than to
avoid a group of monsters (or sometimes, it's the monsters
avoiding the adventurers). If one group is surprised, and the
other is not, the unsurprised group may be able to escape
automatically (unless something prevents them from making an
exit).

Otherwise, the characters wanting to flee begin doing so on
their Initiative numbers. The GM may easily play out the
pursuit, following along on his or her map (note that the
players can't draw maps while they run headlong through the
dungeon or wilderness area). Any time a character must pass
through a doorway, make a hard turn, etc., the GM may require a
saving throw vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added); if the
save is failed, the character has fallen at that point and
moves no further that round; he or she may stand up and make a
full move on his or her Initiative number in the next round.

If at any point the pursuers are within 5' (melee range) at the
start of a round, they may begin melee combat; the fleeing
characters will be subject to “parting shots” as described
under Defensive Movement if they continue to flee after the
pursuers close to melee range.

If the fleeing characters or creatures are ever able to get
beyond the pursuer's sight for a full round, they have evaded
pursuit… the pursuers have lost them.

Defensive Movement

Any time a character turns his or her back on an adjacent
opponent (who has a ready weapon) and begins movement, that
opponent is allowed a “parting shot” with a +2 bonus to attack,
even if that opponent has already made all attacks for the
round. Opponents with attack routines must choose one attack
mode; for instance, a tiger with a claw/claw/bite routine could
only claw once or bite once.

Alternately, the character may begin backing away (at up to half
normal walking movement) while continuing to fight (if the
opponent remains within reach, that is, follows the retreating
character). This is termed a fighting withdrawal.

How to Attack

To roll “to hit,” the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds his or her
attack bonus (AB), as shown on the table on page 47, as well as
Strength bonus (if performing a melee attack) or Dexterity bonus
(if performing a missile attack) and any other adjustments
required by the situation. If the total is equal to or greater
than the opponent's Armor Class, the attack hits and damage is
rolled. A natural “1” on the die roll is always a failure. A
natural “20” is always a hit, if the opponent can be hit at all
(for example, monsters that can only be hit by silver or magic
weapons cannot be hit by normal weapons, so a natural “20” with
a normal weapon will not hit such a monster).

Attacking from Behind

Attacks made from behind an opponent usually receive a +2 attack
bonus. This does not combine with the Sneak Attack ability (see
the Thief, above).

Normal Men

A note about normal men: The NM entry in the table above is for
normal men, also known as zero level characters. These
characters represent the artisans, shopkeepers, scullery maids,
and other non-adventurer characters who will appear in the game.
All such characters are NPCs, of course. Demi-human races have
few if any zero-level characters among their numbers; the vast
majority of “normal men” are humans.

Average zero-level humans have 1d4 hit points, and usually are
not proficient with any weapons except bare hands. Green troops
(those who have not been in battle yet) are zero-level, but they
have 1d6 hit points and are allowed to use any weapon allowed to
a Fighter.

It is recommended not to waste time in detailing the ability
score or other statistics of such characters further; they are
normal, as in “average,” and so very few would have extreme
statistics. A blacksmith might be credited with a Strength
score of 13 or more, or a savant with Intelligence of 16 or
more, but in general such things need not be detailed for most
of these characters.

Monster Attack Bonus

When looking up a monster's hit dice on the Attack Bonus Table,
ignore all “plus” or “minus” values; so a monster with 3+2 hit
dice, or one with 3-1, is still treated as just 3 hit dice. The
exception is monsters with 1-1 or lower hit dice, which are
considered less than one hit die and have an attack bonus of
+0.

Melee Combat

Melee occurs after a character has closed for combat and strikes
at a monster or other foe. Melee weapons or attacks may
generally only be used against foes who are engaged with the
attacker (as described above).

Missile Fire

Missile weapons may be used to attack foes at a distance. The
distance the attacker is from his target affects the attack
roll, as shown on the Missile Weapon Ranges table in the
Characters section, above. In general, opponents within Short
range are attacked at +1 on the die, those beyond Short range
but within Medium range are attacked at +0, and those beyond
Medium but within Long range are attacked at -2. Foes beyond
Long range cannot be effectively attacked.

If a character attempts to use a missile weapon against a foe
who is within 5' of him or her (i.e. who is engaged with the
shooter), a penalty of -5 is applied to the attack roll. This
is due to the shooter dodging around to avoid the foe's
attacks. The only exception is if the attacker is behind the
target creature and undetected, or that creature is distracted
so as to not be able to attack the shooter; in these cases,
apply the usual +1 bonus (+3 total bonus if attacking from
behind).

Cover and Concealment

In certain situations, the intended target of a missile (or
melee) attack may have cover or concealment of some kind. Cover
is defined as “hard” protection such as that afforded by a thick
tree trunk or stone wall, that is, anything that will stop or
slow a missile weapon. Concealment is “soft” cover like fog or
light foliage that makes the target difficult to see but does
not affect the missile itself. Cover or concealment makes it
more difficult to strike an intended target, and thus a penalty
will be applied to the attacker's die roll depending upon how
much of the target is protected from attack. For concealment
the attack penalty should range from -1 (25% obscured) to -4
(90% obscured). For hard cover, these penalties should be
doubled.

Missile Weapon Rate of Fire

In general, missile weapons are allowed a single attack per
round, just as are melee weapons. However, crossbows are an
exception, as reloading a crossbow between shots is
time-consuming.

A light crossbow can be fired once per two rounds, and the user
may not perform any other actions (including movement) during
the “reloading” round. A heavy crossbow can be fired just once
per three rounds, again requiring the user to spend two rounds
doing nothing other than cocking and loading the weapon in
order to fire it again.

Of course, the user of such a weapon may drop or sling the
weapon and switch to another weapon rather than reloading.
Also, it is possible (especially when defending a position) to
load more than one crossbow in advance and then switch weapons
each round until all have been fired. In a dungeon environment
this sort of strategy is unlikely, of course.

[-- Image: graphics19 --]

Grenade-Like Missiles

When throwing grenade-like missiles (flasks of oil, etc.), a
successful attack roll indicates a direct hit. Otherwise, the
GM will roll 1d10 and consult the diagram below to determine
where the missile hit. Treat each number as representing a 10'
square area.

Missiles That Miss

With the exception of grenade-like missiles, missile weapons
which miss the intended target are normally considered lost.
However, if the weapon is fired into a melee where allies of
the shooter are involved, and the attack misses, it may hit one
of the allied creatures. The GM should decide which allies may
be hit, and roll attacks against each until a hit is made or
all possible targets are exhausted. These attack rolls are made
with the shooter's normal attack bonus, just as if he or she
intended to attack the allied creature. However, the GM must
make these rolls, not the player.

This rule is applied to attacks made by monsters, when
appropriate. However, the GM still makes the rolls.

This rule is intentionally vague; the GM must decide when and
how to apply it based on the circumstances of the battle. It is
recommended that no more than three allies be “tried” in this
way, but the GM may make an exception as he or she sees fit.

Damage

If an attack hits, the attacker rolls damage as given for the
weapon. Melee attacks apply the Strength bonus or penalty to
the damage dice, as do thrown missile weapons such as daggers
or spears. Usually, bows and crossbows do not gain the Strength
bonus, but sling bullets or stones do.

Also, magic weapons will add their bonuses to damage (and cursed
weapons will apply their penalty). Note that, regardless of any
penalties to damage, any successful hit will do at least one
point of damage.

As explained elsewhere, a creature or character reduced to 0 hit
points is dead.

Subduing Damage

Attacks made with the “flat of the blade” for non-lethal damage
are made at a -4 attack penalty and do half damage. Most
weapons can be used this way; only those with penetration or
slashing features on all sides cannot.

If a character is reduced to zero hit points who has taken at
least some subduing damage, the character becomes unconscious
rather than dying. (Any further subduing damage is then
considered killing damage, allowing the possibility that
someone might be beaten to death.) A character knocked out in
this way, but not subsequently killed, will wake up with 1 hit
point in 1d4 turns, or can be awakened (with 1 hit point) by
someone else after 2d10 rounds.

Brawling

Sometimes a character will attack without a weapon, striking
with a fist or foot. This is called brawling. Normal characters
do 1d3 points of subduing damage with a punch, 1d4 with a kick;
kicks are rolled at a -2 attack penalty. A character in no
armor or leather armor cannot successfully punch or kick a
character in metal armor, and in fact, if this is attempted the
damage is applied to the attacker instead of the defender. The
GM must decide which monsters can be successfully attacked this
way. All character classes may engage in brawling; there is no
“weapon” restriction in this case.

Wrestling

A wrestling attack requires a successful melee attack roll,
where success indicates the attacker has grabbed his or her
opponent. This hold is maintained until the attacker releases
it or the defender makes a save vs. Death Ray, which is
attempted at the defender's next action (according to
Initiative). A successful wrestling attack causes the attacker
to move into the same “space” as the defender (if miniature
figures are used).

After achieving a hold on an opponent, the attacker can
automatically inflict unarmed damage (as if striking with a
fist), prevent a held opponent from speaking, use simple magic
items such as rings, or take any other action the GM allows.
The attacker may also attempt to acquire an item the opponent
is holding (such as a weapon) or attempt to move the opponent
(as described below). A held character may be voluntarily
released whenever the attacker so desires.

The attacker can’t draw or use a weapon or use a wand, staff,
scroll or potion, escape another’s wrestling attack, cast a
spell, or pin another character while holding an opponent.

Moving the Opponent: The attacker can move up to one-half speed
(bringing the defender along) with a successful attack roll, if
the attacker is strong enough to carry or drag the defender.

Acquiring an Object: The attacker may attempt to take an item
away from the defender. This requires an additional attack
roll; if the roll fails, the defender may immediately attempt
an attack roll (even if he or she has already attacked this
round) which, if successful, results in the defender pinning
the attacker; or, the defender may choose to escape instead of
reversing the hold.

Actions Allowed to the Defender: The target of a successful hold
is usually immobile (but not helpless) at least until his or her
next action, as determined by Initiative. Such characters suffer
a penalty of -4 to AC against opponents other than the attacker.

If the defender is significantly stronger and/or larger than the
attacker, he or she may move at up to one-half speed, dragging
the attacker along.

On the defender's next action, he or she can try to escape the
pin with a saving throw vs. Death Ray; the defender must apply
the better of his or her Strength or Dexterity bonuses (or
penalties) on this roll. If the escape roll succeeds, the
defender finishes the action by moving into any space adjacent
to the attacker.

If more than one attacker has a hold on a particular defender, a
successful escape roll frees the defender from just one of those
attackers.

Held characters may also use simple magic items such as rings. A
character being held may not normally cast a spell, even if he
or she has not been silenced by the attacker.

Multiple Opponents: Several combatants can be involved in a
wrestling match. Up to four combatants can wrestle a single
opponent of normal size in a given round. Creatures that are
smaller than the attacker count for half, while creatures that
are larger count at least double (as determined by the GM).
Note that, after an opponent is pinned, other attackers benefit
from the -4 AC penalty applied to the defender. However, this AC
penalty is not cumulative (that is, each successful attack does
not lower the defender's AC further).

It is also possible for another character to attack the attacker
in an ongoing wrestling bout. In this case, a successful hold on
the attacker grants the original defender a +4 bonus on
subsequent escape rolls.

Wrestling With Monsters: In general, the rules above can be used
not only when character races wrestle but also when humanoid
monsters are involved. The GM will decide whether or not to
allow wrestling involving non-humanoid creatures on a
case-by-case basis; if this is allowed, the following
adjustments apply:

Creatures with extra grasping appendages (more than the usual
two) gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls or saving throws for each
such appendage. This includes creatures with feet capable of
grasping (such as monkeys or apes, giant spiders, etc.)

Large creatures able to fly may attempt to carry off their
opponents (even if the flying creature is the defender).

Wrestling attacks against creatures with touch attacks (such as
wights) will cause the attacker to suffer one such attack
automatically every round.

Oil

A flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like missile. The oil
must be set afire in order to inflict damage; otherwise the oil
is just slippery. Assuming some means of igniting the oil is at
hand, a direct hit to a creature deals 1d8 points of fire
damage, plus in the next round the target takes an additional
1d8 points of damage, unless he or she spends the round
extinguishing the flames by some reasonable means. The GM must
judge the method used; rolling on the floor (assuming it's not
oily also) or covering the flames with a wet blanket are good
methods, for instance, while pouring or splashing water on
burning oil does little good. In any event, a flask of burning
oil only causes damage for two rounds at most.

If the oil is ignited by some sort of wick or fuse, then every
other creature within 5 feet of the point of impact receives
1d6 points of fire damage from the splash. A save vs. Death Ray
is allowed to avoid this damage. If the flask does not hit the
intended target (as described under Grenade-Like Missiles,
above), then that creature may still take damage from the
splash, and receives a saving throw. No saving throw is allowed
for a creature which has received a direct hit.

A flask of oil spilled or splattered on the ground will burn for
10 rounds. Those attempting to cross the burning oil will
receive 1d6 points of fire damage each round they are in it
(with no saving throw in this case).

Fire-resistant creatures, including creatures having fire-based
abilities, receive no damage from burning oil.

Holy Water

Holy water damages undead creatures. A flask of holy water can
be thrown as a grenade-like missile; the flask breaks if thrown
against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against
an incorporeal creature, it must be opened and poured out onto
the target, generally requiring the attacker to be adjacent to
the target.

A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 1d8 points of damage
to an undead creature. In addition, each such creature within 5
feet of the point of impact receives 1d6 points of damage from
the splash. Holy water is only effective for one round.

Morale

NPCs and monsters don't always fight to the death; in fact, most
will try to avoid death whenever possible. Each monster listing
includes the monster's Morale score, a figure between 2 and 12.
To make a Morale check, roll 2d6; if the roll is equal to or
less than the Morale score, the monster or monsters are willing
to stand and fight. If the roll is higher than the score, the
monster has lost its nerve. Monsters with a Morale score of 12
never fail a Morale check; they always fight to the death.

In general, Morale is checked when monster(s) first encounter
opposition, and again when the monster party is reduced to half
strength (by numbers if more than one monster, or by hit points
if the monster is alone). For this purpose, monsters
incapacitated by sleep, charm, or hold magic are counted as if
dead.

The Game Master may apply adjustments to a monster's Morale
score in some situations, at his or her discretion. Generally,
adjustments should not total more than +2 or -2. No adjustment
is ever applied to a Morale score of 12.

A monster that fails a Morale check will generally attempt to
flee; intelligent monsters or NPCs may attempt to surrender, if
the GM so desires.

Note that special rules apply to retainers; see the relevant
rules in the Adventure section, above.

Turning the Undead

Clerics can Turn the undead, that is, drive away undead monsters
by means of faith alone. The Cleric brandishes his or her holy
symbol and calls upon the power of his or her divine patron.
The player rolls 1d20 and tells the GM the result. Note that
the player should always roll, even if the GM knows the
character can't succeed (or can't fail), as telling the player
whether or not to roll may reveal too much.

The GM looks up the Cleric's level on the Clerics vs. Undead
table, and cross-references it with the undead type. If the
table indicates “No” for that combination, it is not possible
for the Cleric to affect that type of undead monster. If the
table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20
to Turn that sort of undead. If the table says “T” for that
combination, that type of undead is automatically affected (no
roll needed). If the result shown is a “D,” then that sort of
undead will be Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than
merely Turned.

If the roll is a success, 2d6 hit dice of undead monsters are
affected; surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are being
Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies can be
Turned), but a minimum of one creature will always be affected
if the first roll succeeds.

If a mixed group of undead (say, a wight and a pair of zombies)
is to be Turned, the player still rolls just once. The result
is checked against the weakest sort first (the zombies), and if
they are successfully Turned, the same result is checked against
the next higher type of undead. Likewise, the 2d6 hit dice are
rolled only once. For example, if the group described above is
to be Turned by a 2nd level Cleric, he or she would first need
to have rolled a 15 or higher to Turn the zombies. If this is a
success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 7, this
would Turn both zombies and leave a remainder of 3 hit dice of
effect. Wights are, in fact, 3 hit die monsters, so assuming
the original 1d20 roll was a 20, the wight is Turned as well.
Obviously, were it a group of 3 zombies and a wight, the 2d6
roll would have to be a total of 9 or higher to affect them
all.

If a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all undead
monsters present are affected, he or she may try again in the
next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Turn
the Undead fails, that Cleric may not attempt to Turn Undead
again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a
mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose.

Undead monsters which are Turned flee from the Cleric and his or
her party at maximum movement. If the party pursue and corner
the Turned undead, they may resume attacking the party; but if
left alone, the monsters will not return or attempt to attack
the Cleric or those near him or her for at least 2d4 turns.

Undead monsters subject to a D (Damaged) result suffer 1d8
damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and apply the same
damage to all undead monsters affected); those reduced to zero
hit points are utterly destroyed, being blasted into little
more than dust. Those surviving this damage are still Turned as
above.

Energy Drain

Sometimes characters are exposed to energy drain from undead or
evil magic. Such energy drain is manifested in the form of
“negative levels.” For each negative level a victim receives,
he or she suffers a semi-permanent loss of one hit die worth of
hit points and a penalty of -1 on all attack and saving throw
rolls. The victim may or may not be allowed a saving throw to
resist the effect (depending on the specific monster type).

If the character's hit points are reduced to zero or less by
means of energy drain, the victim is immediately slain. If the
energy drain is caused by an undead monster, the victim will
usually be transformed into that sort of undead (exact details
vary by type of monster).

Negative levels may be removed by magic. When a negative level
is to be removed, divide the total number of hit points lost by
the number of negative levels (rounding normally) to determine
how many hit points are restored.

For example, a character suffers three negative levels of energy
drain. The hit point losses rolled were 6, 5, and 2, for a total
of 13 points lost. The first negative level removed restores 13
/ 3 = 4.3333 hit points (which is rounded to 4 even). Now the
character has two negative levels and has lost 9 hit points.
The next time a negative level is removed, the character
recovers 9 / 2 = 4.5 hit points, which is rounded to 5 even.
Now the character has one negative level and 4 hit points lost.
Removal of the last negative level will restore the remaining 4
points.

Those who have suffered energy drain generally have a gaunt,
haggard look about them, noticeable by observant characters.

Healing and Rest

Characters recover 1 hit point of damage every day, provided
that normal sleep is possible. Characters who choose full
bedrest regain an additional hit point each evening.

Normal characters require 6 hours sleep out of every 24.
Subtract from this number of hours the character's Constitution
bonus; so a character with 18 Constitution needs only 3 hours
sleep per night (and a character with 3 Constitution needs 9
hours). Note that these figures are minimums; given a choice,
most characters would prefer to sleep two or more hours longer.

Characters who get less than the required amount of sleep suffer
a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws (as well as
not receiving any hit points of healing). For each additional
night where sufficient sleep is not received, the penalty
becomes one point worse. Regardless of how long the character
has gone without adequate sleep, the normal amount of sleep
will remove these penalties.

Constitution Point Losses

Any character who has lost Constitution points temporarily (such
as due to a disease) may regain them with normal rest. The rate
of recovery is one point per day, awarded each morning when the
character awakens from a normal night's sleep. If more than one
Constitution point was lost, the character must make a save vs.
Death Ray (without adjustments) to regain the final point;
failure results in a permanent loss of that point.

If a Constitution loss results in a lower bonus or penalty, the
character's maximum hit points must be reduced appropriately;
for instance, a character reduced from 16 to 15 Constitution
goes from +2 to +1, thus losing one hit point per die rolled.
If a reduction in maximum hit points reduces that figure to
less than the character's current hit points, reduce the
current hit points to the new maximum hit point figure
immediately.

When regaining Constitution, any increase that increases the
character's Constitution bonus results in the restoration of
the hit points lost due to the reduction, added to the maximum
hit point figure only. Current hit points will not be improved
in this fashion, but rather must be regained by normal healing.

Falling Damage

Characters suffer 1d6 damage per 10' fallen, up to a maximum
20d6. Fractional distances are rounded to the nearest whole
number, so that a fall of 1-4' does no damage, 5'-14' does 1d6,
etc.

Deafness and Blindness

A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel,
is surprised on 1-3 on 1d6, and suffers a -1 penalty to its
Initiative rolls. A blinded creature is surprised on 1-4 on
1d6, suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, a -4 penalty to
its Armor Class, and a -2 penalty to its Initiative rolls.
These effects are modified when dealing with monsters having
unusual sensory abilities; for example, bats may be affected by
deafness as if blinded instead.

These penalties are for characters or creatures recently
handicapped. Those who are normally blind or deaf may have
reduced penalties at the GM's option.

Note that the penalty for attacking an invisible opponent is the
same as the penalty for attacking blind, that is, -4 on the
attack roll.

Attacking a Vehicle

Attacks against vehicles (such as wagons or ships) are made
against Armor Class 11. Each vehicle has listed Hardness and
Hit Point values. Roll damage against the vehicle, and then
reduce that damage by the Hardness value. Any excess damage is
applied to the vehicle.

If the vehicle takes damage equal to or greater than the listed
HP on one side, it is reduced to half speed due to wheel damage
or a hull breach; if it takes this much again, it is
immobilized, and this much damage will sink a ship.

Repairing a Vehicle

Damage done to a vehicle may be restored at a rate of 1d4 hit
points per crew member per hour of labor. However, a vehicle
can only be restored to 90% of its maximum hit points by field
repairs; a damaged ship must be put into drydock and repaired
by a shipwright and his crew, while a wagon, cart or chariot
will require a wagonmaker to repair them. Costs of such repairs
are left to the Game Master to decide.

Saving Throws

Saving throws represent the ability of a character or creature
to resist or avoid special attacks, such as spells or poisons.
Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll, with a
target number based on the character's class and level; for
monsters, a comparable class and level are provided for the
purpose of determining the monster's saving throw figures. A
natural (unadjusted) roll of 1 on a saving throw is always a
failure, while a natural 20 is always a success.

The are five categories of saving throw are as follows: Death
Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, Dragon
Breath, and Spells. Spells and monster special attacks will
indicate which category applies (when a saving throw is
allowed), but in some unusual situations the Game Master will
need to choose a category. One way to make this choice is to
interpret the categories metaphorically. For example, a GM
might be writing an adventure wherein there is a trap that
pours burning oil on the hapless adventurers. Avoiding the oil
might be considered similar to avoiding Dragon Breath. Or
perhaps a stone idol shoots beams of energy from its glaring
eyes when approached. This attack may be considered similar to
a Magic Wand, or if especially potent, a Spell.

In general, saving throw rolls are not adjusted by ability score
bonus or penalty figures. There are a few exceptions:

* Poison saving throws are always adjusted by the Constitution
bonus of the character.

* Saving throws against illusions (such as phantasmal force) are
always adjusted by the character's Intelligence.

The GM may decide on other saving throw adjustments, as he or
she sees fit.

Item Saving Throws

Area effects (such as fireball or lightning bolt spells) may
damage items carried by a character as well as injuring the
character. For simplicity, assume that items carried are
unaffected if the character or creature carrying them makes its
saving throw. However, very fragile items (paper vs. fire, glass
vs. physical impact, etc.) may still be considered subject to
damage even if the bearer makes his or her save.

In any case where one or more items may be subject to damage,
use the saving throw roll of the bearer to determine if the
item is damaged or not. For example, a character holding an
open spellbook is struck by a fireball spell; he or she must
save vs. Spells, and then save again at the same odds for the
spellbook.

The GM should feel free to amend this rule as he or she sees
fit; for instance, a backpack full of fragile items might be
given a single saving throw rather than laboriously rolling for
each and every item.
