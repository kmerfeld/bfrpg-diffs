PART 1: INTRODUCTION

It was our third foray into the dungeons beneath the ancient
fortress in the middle of the river. We were on the second
level down from the ruins, standing before the great bronze
doors beyond which we believed lay the tomb of an ancient
barbarian chieftain. I hadn't believed the tales of the old
drunk at the tavern back at Morgansfort, but for some reason
Apoqulis the Cleric believed him. Turned out his stories were
true... mostly, anyway.

I held a torch for Barthal the Thief as he tried briefly to pick
the lock. He turned around and said, "It must be held by magic.
The lock won't even wiggle."

Morningstar the Elf smiled. "I have just the thing," she said,
drawing from her backpack the scroll we took from the goblins.
She unrolled it and began to read, and though I couldn't
understand her words I could see the characters burning away as
she read them, little wisps of smoke as from a candle rising up
from each in turn. Seeing that she was nearly through, I turned
my attention to the lock. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but
the little puff of dust that came from it as she finished didn't
seem like much. She turned to Barthal and said, "Try again."

I'm tempted to say that Barthal bent to his work, but he's a
Halfling; at just over three feet tall he could look straight
into the lock without stooping a bit. I must have looked
impatient, as Apoqulis leaned over to me and said "Be still,
Darion, he'll be through in a moment or two."

Then I heard a loud click, and Barthal turned to me with a
smile. "It's open, my friend. After you!" I handed him the
torch, then stepped to the doors, sword drawn, and Morningstar
joined me, likewise ready. I steeled myself and opened the
doors...

Beyond lay a stone sarcophagus, resting atop a raised platform.
Strewn about the floor were many human skeletons. Apoqulis made
a sign with his hand that I didn't recognize; then we walked in
carefully, trying not to trip over the bones. I noticed among
the bones several bronze swords, covered in verdigris. I
stepped to the sarcophagus. "The lid is likely very heavy, " I
said. "Come, Morningstar, rather than lift it, let's turn it
about so we can see what treasures lay inside."

[-- Image: graphics2 --]Morningstar called "Wait!" but it was
too late... I had already laid hands upon the sarcophagus. The
bones on the floor began to rattle, then rose up and assembled
themselves in a mockery of life. Without delay they picked up
their swords from the floor and began to attack us. I would
have to wait until later to kick myself, I mused, as I put my
back against the sarcophagus and began to fight the monsters...

What is this?

The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game system
based on the d20 SRD v3.5, but heavily rewritten with
inspiration from early RPG game systems. It is intended for
those who are fans of "old-school" game mechanics. Basic
Fantasy RPG is simple enough for children in perhaps second or
third grade to play, yet still has enough depth for adults as
well.

What is a Role-Playing Game?

In the more than 30 years since the first role-playing game
appeared, much has changed. Most people have at least heard the
names of one or two such games, and many, many people have
played. Still, there are those who have not tried RPGs; if you
are one of those people, this part is for you.

Role-playing games are played by a number of players, commonly
two to eight, and a Game Master, or GM (often called something
else, but the job remains the same regardless). Each player
generally plays one character, called a player character or PC,
while the Game Master is responsible for running the world,
creating and managing the towns, nations, ruins, non-player
characters (or NPCs), monsters, treasure, and all other things
that aid or challenge the players. Dice are often used to
determine the success or failure of most actions that take
place in the game; Basic Fantasy RPG uses polyhedral dice,
described below, for this purpose.

In effect, role-playing games are just grown-up games of
pretend. If you remember playing pretend as a child, you may
recall having some difficulty deciding whose idea should have
precedence... if one child plays a knight and the other a
dragon, who will win? Surely the knight doesn't win every time.
Role-playing games have rules to determine such things. These
rules can range from the very free-form and simple to the very
complex and detailed.

This game attempts to walk the line between simple and complex,
free-form and detailed. Too much detail and complexity slows
the game down as players and GM spend much time leafing through
the rules and little time actually playing. Free-form games with
simple resolution systems demand more mental agility from the
participants, and are much more dependent on the good judgment
of the Game Master to maintain balance. Basic Fantasy
Role-Playing Game falls between these two extremes, having
rules for the most common activities and guidelines to help the
Game Master judge the unexpected.

What Do I Need To Play?

If you are to be a player, you should have a pencil, some
notebook paper, and a set of dice. Someone in your player group
probably needs to have some graph paper (4 or 5 squares per inch
is best) for drawing maps. You can use preprinted character
records (such as those available on the Basic Fantasy RPG
website) if you wish, but notebook paper works fine.

If you are the Game Master, you need all of the above. If this
is your first time as GM, or you have limited preparation time,
you might wish to use a pre-written adventure (called a module)
rather than to create one yourself.

Using the Dice

[-- Image: graphics4 --]The 20 sided die, or d20, is one of the
most important dice in the game: it is used to resolve attack
rolls and saving throws (concepts that will be explained
later). In general, the die is rolled, modifiers added or
subtracted, and if the total result equals or exceeds a target
number, the roll is a success; otherwise it has failed.

[-- Image: graphics5 --][-- Image: graphics6 --]The 10 sided
die, or d10, is used to generate numbers from 1 to 10; it is
numbered 0 to 9, but a roll of 0 is counted as 10. A pair of
d10's are also used together to generate numbers from 1 to 100,
where a roll of 00 is counted as 100. The two dice should be
different colors, and the player must declare which is the tens
die and which is the ones die before rolling them! (Or, the
player may have a die marked with double digits, as shown.)
Rolling two d10's this way is called a percentile roll, or d%.
These rolls are generally against target numbers, but for the
roll to be a success, the result must be equal to or less than
the target number. So for example, a character using a Thief
ability (described later) with a 30% chance of success rolls
the dice: if the result is 01 to 30, the roll is a success.

[-- Image: graphics7 --][-- Image: graphics8 --]The 4 sided die,
or d4, is a special case. It is not so much rolled as “flipped,”
and the number which is upright is the result of the roll. Note
that d4's are made in two different styles, as shown.

[-- Image: graphics9 --][-- Image: graphics10 --]The other dice
normally used have 6, 8, and 12 sides, and are called d6, d8,
and d12. d6's may be made with either numbers or pips; it makes
no difference which sort you choose.

[-- Image: graphics11 --]When multiple dice are to be rolled and
added together, it's noted in the text like this: 2d6 (roll two
d6 dice and add them together), or 3d4 (roll three d4 dice and
add them together). A modifier may be noted as a “plus” value,
such as 2d8+2 (roll two d8 dice and add them together, then add
2 to the total).

PART 2: PLAYER CHARACTER INFORMATION

How To Create A Player Character

First, you will need a piece of paper to write down the
character's statistics on. You may use a character record sheet
form if one is available, or you may simply use a piece of
notebook paper. An example character is shown below. You should
use a pencil to write down all information, as any statistic may
change during game play.

Roll 3d6 for each ability score (as listed below) and write the
results after the names of the abilities. Write down the scores
in the order you roll them; if you are unhappy with the scores
you have rolled, ask your Game Master for advice, as he or she
may allow some form of point or score exchanging.

Write down the ability score bonus (or penalty) for each score
beside the score itself, as shown on the table on the next
page.

Choose a race and class for your character. Remember that you
must meet the Prime Requisite minimum for a class, as described
in the Character Classes section, in order to be a member of
that class. Also note that there are minimum (and maximum)
ability requirements for the various races which must be met,
as described in the Character Races section.

Write down the special abilities of your race and class choices,
as described below. If you have chosen to play a Magic-User, ask
your Game Master what spell or spells your character knows; it's
up to the Game Master to decide this, but he or she may allow
you to choose one or more spells yourself.

Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0)
experience points (or XP); also you may want to note the number
needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for
your class.

Roll the hit die appropriate for your class, adding your
Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit
points on your character sheet. Note that, should your
character have a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not
lower any hit die roll below 1 (so if your Character has a -2
penalty for Constitution, and you roll a 2, the total is
adjusted to 1).

Roll for your starting money. Generally your character will
start with 3d6 times 10 gold pieces, but ask the Game Master
before rolling.

Now, purchase equipment for your character, as shown in the Cost
of Weapons and Equipment section, below. Write your purchases on
your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward.
Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for
your class and race before making your purchases.

Since you now know what sort of armor your character is wearing,
you should note your Armor Class on your character sheet. Don't
forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to the figure.

Look up your character's attack bonus (from the table in the
Encounter section) and note it on your character sheet. Don't
add your ability bonuses (or penalties) to this figure, as you
will add a different bonus (Strength or Dexterity) depending on
the sort of weapon you use in combat (i.e. melee or missile
weapon).

Also look up your saving throws and note them on your character
sheet. Adjust the saving throw figures based on your race, if
your character is a demi-human (see Character Races, below).

Finally, if you haven't done so already, name your character.

[-- Image: graphics3 --]

Character Abilities

Each character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of
the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with
each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has a Prime
Requisite ability score, which must be at least 9 in order for
the character to become a member of that class; also, there are
required minimum and maximum scores for each character race
other than Humans, as described under Character Races, below.

Strength: As the name implies, this ability measures the
character's raw physical power. Strength is the Prime Requisite
for Fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to
all attack and damage rolls in melee (hand to hand) combat. Note
that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful
attack below one point in any case (see the Combat section for
details).

Intelligence: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge.
Intelligence is the Prime Requisite for Magic-Users. The
ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of
languages the character is able to learn to read and write; if
the character has an Intelligence penalty, he or she cannot
read more than a word or two, and will only know his or her
native language.

Wisdom: A combination of intuition, willpower and common sense.
Wisdom is the Prime Requisite for Clerics. The Wisdom bonus or
penalty may apply to some saving throws vs. magical attacks,
particularly those affecting the target's will.

Dexterity: This ability measures the character's quickness and
balance as well as aptitude with tools. Dexterity is the Prime
Requisite for Thieves. The Dexterity bonus or penalty is
applied to all attack rolls with missile (ranged) weapons, to
the character's Armor Class value, and to the character's
Initiative die roll.

Constitution: A combination of general health and vitality.
Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each hit die rolled
by the character. Note that a penalty here will not reduce any
hit die roll to less than 1 point.

Charisma: This is the ability to influence or even lead people;
those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly
respected. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to reaction
rolls. Also, the number of retainers a character may hire is
equal to 4 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty (and therefore
ranges from 1 to 7); the average morale of any such retainers
will be equal to 7 plus the Charisma bonus or penalty.

Hit Points and Hit Dice

When a character is injured, he or she loses hit points from his
or her current total. Note that this does not change the figure
rolled, but rather reduces the current total; healing will
restore hit points, up to but not exceeding the rolled figure.

When his or her hit point total reaches 0, your character is
probably dead. This is not necessarily the end for the
character; don't tear up the character sheet.

First level characters begin play with a single hit die of the
given type, plus the Constitution bonus or penalty, with a
minimum of 1 hit point. Each time a character gains a level,
the player should roll another hit die and add the character's
Constitution bonus or penalty, with the result again being a
minimum of 1 point. Add this amount to the character's maximum
hit points figure. Note that, after 9th level, characters
receive a fixed number of hit points each level, as shown in
the advancement table for the class, and no longer add the
Constitution bonus or penalty.

Languages

All characters begin the game knowing their native language. In
most campaign worlds, Humans all (or nearly all) speak the same
language, often called “Common.” Each demi-human race has its
own language, i.e. Elvish, Dwarvish, or Halfling, and members
of the demi-human races begin play knowing both their own
language and Common (or the local Human language if it isn't
called Common).

Characters with Intelligence of 13 or higher may choose to begin
the game knowing one or more languages other than those given
above; the number of additional languages that may be learned
is equal to the Intelligence bonus (+1, +2, or +3). Humans may
use these bonus languages to learn one or more of the
demi-human languages, or any character may choose to learn one
or more humanoid languages (such as Orc, Goblin, etc.). The GM
will decide which humanoid languages may be learned. The player
may choose to leave one or more bonus language "slots" open, to
be filled during play.

Clerics are those who have devoted themselves to the service of
a deity, pantheon or other belief system. Most Clerics spend
their time in mundane forms of service such as preaching and
ministering in a temple; but there are those who are called to
go abroad from the temple and serve their deity in a more
direct way, smiting undead monsters and aiding in the battle
against evil and chaos. Player character Clerics are assumed to
be among the latter group.

Clerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as
Fighters. They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower
levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief
would deftly avoid. Clerics can cast spells of divine nature
starting at 2nd level, and they have the power to Turn the
Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of
faith alone (see the Encounter section for details).

The Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom; a character must have
a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Cleric. They may wear
any armor, but may only use blunt weapons (specifically
including warhammer, mace, maul, club, quarterstaff, and
sling).

Fighters include soldiers, guardsmen, barbarian warriors, and
anyone else for whom fighting is a way of life. They train in
combat, and they generally approach problems head on, weapon
drawn.

Not surprisingly, Fighters are best at fighting of all the
classes. They are also the hardiest, able to take more
punishment than any other class. Although they are not skilled
in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic
items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor.

The Prime Requisite for Fighters is Strength; a character must
have a Strength score of 9 or higher to become a Fighter. They
may wear any armor and use any weapon.

Magic-Users are those who seek and use knowledge of the arcane.
They do magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater
power, but rather through insight and understanding.

Magic-Users are the worst of all the classes at fighting; hours
spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character
to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least
hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but falling behind
later on.

The Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character
must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a
Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are
the dagger and the walking staff (or cudgel). Magic-Users may
not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things
interfere with spellcasting.

A first level Magic-User begins play knowing read magic and one
other spell of first level. These spells are written in a
spellbook provided by his or her master. The GM may roll for
the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player
to choose it, at his or her option. See the Spells section for
more details.

Thieves are those who take what they want or need by stealth,
disarming traps and picking locks to get to the gold they
crave; or "borrowing" money from pockets, beltpouches, etc.
right under the nose of the "mark" without the victim ever
knowing.

Thieves fight better than Magic-Users but not as well as
Fighters. Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less
hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the
Magic-Users at higher level.

The Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must
have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief. They
may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it
interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields
of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however.

Thieves have a number of special abilities, described below. One
Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities. The
GM may choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the
player, at his or her option, to help maintain the proper state
of uncertainty. Also note that the GM may apply situational
adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees
fit; for instance, it's obviously harder to climb a wall slick
with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a
penalty of -20% for the slimy wall.

Open Locks allows the Thief to unlock a lock without a proper
key. It may only be tried once per lock. If the attempt fails,
the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of
experience before trying again.

Remove Traps is generally rolled twice: first to detect the
trap, and second to disarm it. The GM will make these rolls as
the player won't know for sure if the character is successful
or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected)
area.

Pick Pockets allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse,
etc. of a victim without the victim noticing. Obviously, if the
roll is failed, the Thief didn't get what he or she wanted; but
further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the GMs option)
will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than two times
the target number (or if the die roll is 00).

Move Silently, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the GM.
The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently
regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to
avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.

Climb Walls permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few
or no visible handholds. This ability should normally be rolled
by the player. If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about
halfway up the wall or other vertical surface. The GM may
require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100
feet.

Hide permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough
to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief always
believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the
roll. A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this
ability to work.

Listen is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to
listen for distant sounds in a dungeon. The GM must decide what
noises the Thief might be able to hear; a successful roll does
not mean that a noise has been heard, but rather that a noise
might have been heard. The GM should always make this roll for
the player. Also note that the Thief and his or her party must
try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.

Finally, Thieves can perform a Sneak Attack any time they are
behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the
opponent doesn't know the Thief is there. The GM may require a
Move Silently or Hide roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack
is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage if it is
successful. A Thief generally can't perform a Sneak Attack on
the same opponent twice in any given combat.

The Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not
missile) weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case
subduing damage is done; see the Encounter section for details).
Also, the Sneak Attack can be performed with the "flat of the
blade;" the bonuses and penalties cancel out, so the attack has
a +0 attack bonus and does normal damage; the damage done in
this case is subduing damage.

Character Races

Dwarves

[-- Image: graphics16 --]Description: Dwarves are a short,
stocky race; both male and female Dwarves stand around four
feet tall and typically weigh around 120 pounds. Their long
hair and thick beards are dark brown, gray or black. They take
great pride in their beards, sometimes braiding or forking
them. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. Dwarves have stout
frames and a strong, muscular build. They are rugged and
resilient, with the capacity to endure great hardships. Dwarves
are typically practical, stubborn and courageous. They can also
be introspective, suspicious and possessive. They have a
lifespan between three and four centuries long.

Restrictions: Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves.
They are required to have a minimum Constitution of 9. Due to
their generally dour dispositions, they may not have a Charisma
higher than 17. They may not employ Large weapons more than four
feet in length (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows).

Special Abilities: All Dwarves have Darkvision with a 60' range,
and are able to detect slanting passages, traps, shifting walls
and new construction on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6; a search must be
performed before this roll may be made.

Saving Throws: Dwarves save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison, Magic
Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs. Dragon
Breath.

Elves

[-- Image: graphics29 --]Description: Elves are a slender race,
with both genders standing around five feet tall and weighing
around 130 pounds. Most have dark hair, with little or no body
or facial hair. Their skin is pale, and they have pointed ears
and fine, delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful,
moving with deftness and ease. They have keen eyesight and
hearing. Elves are typically inquisitive, passionate,
self-assured and sometimes haughty. They have a typical
lifespan of a dozen centuries or more.

Restrictions: Elves may become Clerics, Fighters, Magic-Users or
Thieves; they are also allowed to combine the classes of Fighter
and Magic-User (see Combination Classes, below). They are
required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9. Due to their
generally delicate nature, they may not have a Constitution
higher than 17. Elves never roll larger than six-sided dice
(d6) for hit points.

Special Abilities: All Elves have Darkvision with a 60' range.
They are able to find secret doors more often than normal (1-2
on 1d6 rather than the usual 1 on 1d6). An Elf is so observant
that he or she has a 1 on 1d6 chance to find a secret door with
just a cursory look. Elves are immune to the paralyzing attack
of ghouls.

Saving Throws: Elves save at +1 vs. Paralysis or Petrify and +2
vs. Magic Wands and Spells.

[-- Image: graphics33 --]Halflings

Description: Halflings are small, slightly stocky folk who stand
around three feet tall and weigh about 60 pounds. They have
curly brown hair on their heads and feet, but generally have no
facial hair. They are usually fair skinned, often with ruddy
cheeks. Halflings are remarkably rugged for their small size.
They are dexterous and nimble, capable of moving quietly and
remaining very still. They usually go barefoot. Halflings are
typically outgoing, unassuming and good-natured. They have a
lifespan of around a hundred years.

Restrictions: Halflings may become Clerics, Fighters or Thieves.
They are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9. Due to their
small stature, they may not have a Strength higher than 17.
Halflings never roll larger than six-sided dice (d6) for hit
points regardless of class. Halflings may not use Large
weapons, and must wield Medium weapons with both hands.

Special Abilities: Halflings are unusually accurate with all
sorts of ranged weapons, gaining a +1 attack bonus when
employing them. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than
man-sized, Halflings gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class.
Halflings are quick-witted, thus adding +1 to Initiative die
rolls. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are
able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still
there is only a 10% chance they will be detected. Even indoors,
in dungeons or in non-preferred terrain they are able to hide
such that there is only a 30% chance of detection. Note that a
Halfling Thief will roll for hiding attempts only once, using
either the Thief ability or the Halfling ability, whichever is
better.

Saving Throws: Halflings save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison,
Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs.
Dragon Breath.

Humans

[-- Image: graphics38 --]Description: Humans come in a broad
variety of shapes and sizes; the Game Master must decide what
sorts of Humans live in the game world. An average Human male
in good health stands around six feet tall and weighs about 175
pounds. Most Humans live around 75 years.

Restrictions: Humans may be any class. They have no minimum or
maximum ability score requirements.

Special Abilities: Humans learn unusually quickly, gaining a
bonus of 10% to all experience points earned.

Saving Throws: Humans are the "standard," and thus have no
saving throw bonuses.

Combination Classes

To become a member of a combination class, a character must meet
the requirements of both classes. Combination class characters
use the best attack bonus and the best saving throw values of
their original two classes. One combination class is described
above:

Elven Fighter/Magic-User: These characters may both fight and
cast magic spells; further, they are allowed to cast magic
spells while wearing armor. A Fighter/Magic-User must gain
experience equal to the combined requirements of both base
classes. Elven Fighter/Magic-Users roll six-sided dice (d6) for
hit points.

Cost of Weapons and Equipment

Money

Monetary values are usually expressed in gold pieces. In
addition to gold coins, there are coins made of platinum,
silver, electrum (an alloy of gold and silver), and copper.
They are valued as follows:

1 platinum piece (pp)  = 5 gold pieces (gp)

1 gold piece (gp)  = 10 silver pieces (sp)

1 electrum piece (ep)  = 5 silver pieces (sp)

1 silver piece (sp)  = 10 copper pieces (cp)

For game purposes, assume that one gold piece weighs 1/10th of a
pound, and that five coins will “fit” in a cubic inch of storage
space (this isn't literally accurate, but works well enough when
applied to a box or chest).

First level characters generally begin the game with 3d6 x 10 gp
(unless the GM decides otherwise).

Weapon Size

Humans and Elves must wield Large weapons with both hands, but
may use Small or Medium weapons in one hand. Halflings may not
use Large weapons at all, and must use Medium weapons with both
hands. Dwarves, due to their stocky, powerful builds, are able
to use Medium weapons one-handed and some Large weapons in two
hands, but Large weapons more than four feet in length are
prohibited (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows). Some weapons must be used with both hands by design
(such as bows and crossbows) but the maximum size limits still
apply.

The GM should apply similar limitations to weapon-armed
monsters; for instance, kobolds and goblins are similar in size
to Halflings, and thus should have similar weapon limits.

Missile weapon ranges are given in feet. In the wilderness,
substitute yards for feet. If the target is as close as or
closer than the Short range figure, the attacker gets a +1
attack bonus. If the target is further away than the Medium
range figure, but not beyond the Long range figure, the
attacker receives a -2 attack penalty.

Explanation of Equipment

A Backpack will hold a maximum 40 pounds and/or 3 cubic feet of
goods. Some items may be lashed to the outside; such will count
toward the weight limit but not the volume limit. A Halfling's
backpack holds at most 30 pounds and/or 1½ cubic feet, but
costs the same as a full-sized item.

A Candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with dim light
extending 5' further. A normal candle will burn about 3 turns
per inch of height.

Chalk is useful for “blazing a trail” through a dungeon or ruin,
to ensure that the adventurers can find their way back out
again.

Holy Water is explained in the Encounter section.

Iron Spikes are useful for spiking doors closed (or spiking them
open) and may be used as crude pitons in appropriate situations.

A Lantern will provide light covering a 30' radius; dim light
will extend about 20' further. A lantern will consume a flask
of oil in 18+1d6 turns.

A Map or Scroll Case is a tubular oiled leather case used to
carry maps, scrolls, or other paper items. The case will have a
water-resistant (but not waterproof) cap which slides over the
end, and a loop to allow the case to be hung from a belt or
bandolier. A standard scroll case can hold up to 10 sheets of
paper, or a single scroll of up to seven spells.

A Mirror is useful in a dungeon environment for many reasons;
for instance, it is the only way to look at a Medusa without
being turned to stone. Mirrors are also useful for looking
around corners, and can be used outdoors to send signals using
reflected sunlight.

A Quiver is an open container used to hold arrows. A Bolt Case
is a similar sort of container for crossbow bolts. In either
case, the standard capacity is 20 missiles. The length of a
quiver or bolt case must match the length of the ammunition for
it to be useful; therefore, there are longbow and shortbow
quivers and light and heavy crossbow bolt cases. The price is
the same regardless of the type.

Dry Rations may consist of dry bread, hard cheese, dried fruit,
nuts, beans, jerky, or any other food which will not “go bad”
in less than about a month (if not longer). Dry rations are
generally sold in quantities sufficient for one character for a
week, and are packaged in waxed or oiled cloth to protect them.

Hemp Rope is 1/2 inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of
1,600 pounds. Safe working load for a rope is normally
one-quarter of the breaking strength. One or more knots in a
rope cut the breaking strength in half. This does not affect
the safe working load, because knots are figured into the
listed one-quarter ratio.

Silk Rope is about 3/8 inch in diameter and has a breaking
strength of 1,600 pounds, although it weighs considerably less
than hemp rope. The notes regarding rope strength given for
hemp rope, above, apply here also.

A Large Sack will hold at most 40 pounds and/or 4 cubic feet of
goods.

A Small Sack will hold at most 20 pounds and/or 2 cubic feet of
goods.

A pair of Saddlebags will hold at most 10 pounds and/or 1 cubic
foot of goods (divided evenly between both bags).

Thieves' Picks and Tools are required for the use of Thief
abilities such as opening locks and removing traps. These
abilities may not be usable without appropriate tools, or may
be used at a penalty at the option of the Game Master.

A Tinderbox is generally purchased with a flint and steel; the
flint, a piece of hard rock, is struck vigorously against a
C-shaped piece of high-carbon steel. When done correctly, hot
sparks will fly from the flint and steel into the tinder,
hopefully starting a fire. The best tinder is a dried piece of
prepared tinder fungus, carried in the tinderbox to keep it
dry; char cloth, hemp rope, or even very dry grass can
substitute if prepared tinder fungus is not available. The time
required to start a fire should be determined by the GM
according to the prevailing conditions; under ideal conditions,
starting a fire with a flint, steel and tinder takes about a
turn.

A Torch sheds light over a 30' radius, with dim light extending
about 20' further, and burns for 1d4+4 turns. Of course, a
torch is also useful for setting flammable materials (such as
cobwebs or oil) alight.

A Whetstone is used to sharpen and maintain edged weapons such
as swords, daggers, and axes.

Wineskin/Waterskin is a container for drinking water or wine;
generally water is taken into a dungeon or wilderness
environment. The standard waterskin holds one quart of liquid,
which is the minimum amount required by a normal character in a
single day. If adventuring in the desert or other hot, dry
areas, a character may need as much as ten times this amount.
Note that the given 2 pound weight is for a full skin; an empty
skin has negligible weight.

Vehicles

The following tables give details of various land and sea
vehicles. Game Masters should feel free to create their own
vehicles, in which case the table can be used for guidance.

Notes Regarding Vehicles

The crew figure given reflects the minimum number of sailors
and/or rowers needed to operate the ship. Officers are not
counted among these numbers, and of course it is always a good
idea to hire extra sailors and/or rowers to ensure that any
casualties will not slow down the ship.

Cargo for wagons is given in pounds, while for ships it is given
in tons. If the ship sails night and day, each crewman, officer
and passenger requires living space equivalent to one ton of
cargo; in addition, provisions for one man for one month occupy
1/10 of a ton of space.

Movement is given separately here in feet (yards, actually; see
Time and Scale in Part 4: The Adventure for an explanation) as
well as miles per day. The encounter movement of ships is not
directly related to the long-distance travel rate, since the
crew must work hard to make the ship move quickly in combat,
and this level of effort cannot be maintained day and night.

See Attacking a Vehicle in the Encounter section for details on
the Hardness and HP statistics.

A Caravel is a highly maneuverable sailing ship with two or
three masts. Though superficially similar to the larger
carrack, caravels are capable of sailing up rivers, a task for
which the larger ship is ill suited.

A Carrack is a large, ocean-going sailing ship with three or
four masts.

Galleys are equipped with both sails and oars; the second listed
movement rate for galleys is the rowing speed. A small galley
will have around 20 rows of oars, with each oar pulled by two
men (for a total of 80 rowers) while a large galley will have
around 35 rows of oars (for a total of 140 rowers). Galleys are
generally much more maneuverable than sailing ships such as the
carrack or caravel, and may be outfitted with rams.

The longship commonly used by northern raiders is very similar
to the large galley. However, where more civilized nations have
specialist rowers, sailors, and marines, the crew of a longship
is more generalized; every man is qualified for each of these
tasks.

Siege Engines

These are weapons used to attack strongholds, or sometimes
ships. Their cost may be up to twice as high in a remote
location. A siege engine that throws missiles (a ballista,
onager or trebuchet) must have a trained artillerist to fire
it; this is the character who makes the attack rolls for the
weapon. Missile-throwing engines have attack penalties,
detailed below.

Ballista: This is effectively a very large crossbow that may
fire a spear-like bolt or a large stone. It is usually mounted
on a tripod or wagon, but may also be mounted on a ship. When
firing bolts, a ballista cannot damage brick or stone. A
ballista requires a crew of three to operate.

Battering Ram: These are usually operated under a sow (a sort of
portable roof). They require a crew of eight or more.

Onager: This weapon throws a stone with a fairly flat
trajectory. An onager requires a crew of four to operate.

Trebuchet: This mighty weapon uses a counterweight to fling a
stone on a high, arcing path. It cannot fire at targets within
200 yards. If it is aimed at a target that is more than 20’
higher than the weapon, there is an additional –2 attack
penalty. A trebuchet requires a crew of eight to operate.

PART 3: SPELLS

The number of spells of each level which a Cleric or Magic-User
may cast per day is shown on the appropriate table in the
Characters section, above. Each day, usually in the morning,
spellcasters prepare spells to replace those they have used.
Clerics do this through prayer, while Magic-Users must study
their spellbooks. Spells prepared but not used persist from day
to day; only those actually cast must be replaced. A spellcaster
may always choose to dismiss a prepared spell (without casting
it) in order to prepare a different spell of that level.

Spellcasters must have at least one hand free, and be able to
speak, in order to cast spells; thus, binding and gagging a
spellcaster is an effective means of preventing him or her from
casting spells. In combat, casting a spell usually takes the
same time as making an attack. If a spellcaster is attacked on
the Initiative number on which he or she is casting a spell,
the spell is spoiled and lost.

Some spells are reversible; such spells are shown with an
asterisk after the name.

Cleric Spells

Clerics receive their spells through faith and prayer. Each day,
generally in the morning, a Cleric must pray for at least three
turns in order to prepare spells. Of course, the Cleric may be
expected to pray more than this in order to remain in his or
her deity's good graces.

Because they gain their spells through prayer, a Cleric may
prepare any spell of any level he or she is able to cast.
However, in some cases the Cleric's deity may limit the
availability of certain spells; for instance, a deity devoted
to healing may refuse to grant reversed healing spells.

Magic-User Spells

Magic-Users cast spells through the exercise of knowledge and
will. They prepare spells by study of their spellbooks; each
Magic-User has his or her own spellbook, containing the magical
formulae for each spell the Magic-User has learned, written in a
magical script that can only be read by the Magic-User who wrote
it, or through the use of a special first-level spell: read
magic. All Magic-Users begin play with read magic as their
first spell, and it is so ingrained that a Magic-User can
prepare it without a spellbook. Read magic has a range of
"touch" and is permanent with respect to any given magical work
(spellbook or scroll).

Magic-Users may learn spells by being taught directly by another
Magic-User, or by studying another Magic-User's spellbook. If
being taught, a spell can be learned in a single day;
researching another Magic-User's spellbook takes one day per
spell level. Either way, the spell learned must be transcribed
into the Magic-User's own spellbook, at a cost of 500 gp per
spell level transcribed. A beginning Magic-User starts with a
spellbook containing read magic and at least one other
first-level spell, as determined by the GM, at no cost.

All Spells, in Alphabetical Order

Animate Dead  Range:  touch

Cleric 4, Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into
undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken
commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The
caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to
twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons
have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for
skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die,
regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have
one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated
skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a
zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The
caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may
normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or
her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.

Animate Objects  Range:  100'+10'/level

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a
semblance of life. The animated objects then attack whomever or
whatever the caster designates. This spell cannot animate
objects carried or worn by a creature. An animated object can
be of any non-magical material. The caster can animate one
object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level
(i.e. 300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so
on).

The GM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in
combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same
attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no
more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier
objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM's discretion). As a special
case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die
roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated
objects have a movement rate of 10', and generally must move in
contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or
bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM).

Anti-Magic Shell  Range:  10' radius

Magic-User 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

Within a 10' radius around the caster, all magic is negated for
the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect
the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are
suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until
the spell has expired.

Blade Barrier  Range:  90'

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell creates a wall of whirling blades up to 20' long per
caster level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius
of up to 5' per two levels. Either form will be up to 20 ft.
high (as allowed by available space). Any creature passing
through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level
(maximum 15d6), with a save vs. Death Ray reducing damage to
half.

If the caster evokes the barrier so that it appears where
creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through
the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on
the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a
successful save vs. Death Ray.

A blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) against
attacks made through it.

Bless*  Range:  50' radius

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 minute/level

This spell gives the caster and his or her allies (within a 50'
radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 on attack rolls, morale
checks (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and
saving throws against magical fear.

The reverse of bless is called bane. It fills the caster's
enemies (within a 50' radius) with fear and doubt, causing each
affected creature to suffer a –1 penalty on attack rolls, morale
checks, and saving throws against magical fear.

Charm Animal  Range:  60'

Cleric 2  Duration:  level+1d4 rounds

This spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in
much the same fashion as charm person, at a rate of 1 hit die
per caster level. The caster may decide which individual
animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess
hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed,
either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more
fantastic nature (as determined by the GM) are allowed a save
vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals
will resume normal activity immediately.

Charm Monster  Range:  30'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  special

This spell functions like charm person, except that the effect
is not restricted by creature type or size. Undead monsters are
unaffected. This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice of creatures of 3
or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more than 3 hit dice.
Saving throws are made just as for charm person.

Charm Person  Range:  30'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less
regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and
demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of ability. A
save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If the creature is
currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or
her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The
spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person
as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her
words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try
to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it
wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional
saving throw to overcome the magic (at the GM's discretion).
The caster must speak the target's language to communicate any
commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the
caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect
its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the caster's
enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a “safe”
place). The target receives a new saving throw each day if it
is has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its
Intelligence is 9-12, or every month it its Intelligence is 8
or less.

Clairvoyance  Range:  60'

Magic-User 3  Duration:  12 turns

This spell enables the caster to see into another area through
the eyes of a living creature in that area. The caster must
specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum
of 60' away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area,
the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target
creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may
choose another subject creature after at least a turn has
passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the
subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though
the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.

Cloudkill  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 5  Duration:   6 rds./level

This spell creates a 20'x20' cloud of poison gas, which moves at
a rate of 10' per round under the control of the caster (so long
as he or she concentrates on it). The gas kills outright any
creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it comes in contact
with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice or levels must save
vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists for the entire duration
even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.

Commune  Range:  self

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or
an extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no
question per caster level. The ritual to cast this spell takes
1 turn to complete. The being contacted may or may not be
omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied
with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or
completely. These details are left to the GM's discretion.

Confusion  Range:  360'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  2 rds.+1/level

This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30' radius
circle around the target point to become confused, making them
unable to independently determine what they will do. A saving
throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the
following table at the beginning of each subject’s turn each
round to see what the subject does in that round.

d%

Behavior

01–10

Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster
if attack is not possible).

11–20

Act normally.

21–50

Do nothing but babble incoherently.

51–70

Flee away from caster at top possible speed.

71–100

Attack nearest creature.

A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action
does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any
special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any
confused character who is attacked automatically retaliates on
its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn
comes.

Conjure Elemental  Range:  240'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or
Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental
from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be
summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental
appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the
caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature;
spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate
results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in
control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at
will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the
Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned
Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then
seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only
dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the elemental once
control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to
return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not
choose to remain on the material plane for long.

Continual Light*  Range:  360'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 year/level

This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as
full daylight up to a 30' radius, with light of lesser
intensity to a radius of 60'. Continual light can be cast on an
object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the light
spell, up to a maximum range of 360' from the caster. Creatures
targeted by this spell are allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the
save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the
target creature. The spell remains in effect for one year per
level of the caster.

As with light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if
cast on its visual organs. A saving throw as above is allowed
to avoid this effect. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded
creature's attack rolls if this succeeds.

The reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence
of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light
sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind just as
continual light may.

Create Food  Range:  10'

Cleric 5  Duration:  permanent

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of the caster's
choice, highly nourishing, but rather bland. Up to 3 men or one
horse per caster level can be fed for one day with this spell.
Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours,
although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting
purify food and water on it.

Create Water  Range:  10'

Cleric 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell creates one gallon of water per caster level. Note
that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available
at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just
like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per
gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.

Cure Blindness  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  permanent

With this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering
blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including
light or continual light). Blindness caused by a curse cannot
be cured by this spell.

Cure Disease*  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  instantaneous

Cure disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering
from. The spell also kills parasites, including green slime and
others. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this
spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level
or higher.

Note: Since the spell’s duration is instantaneous, it does not
prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease at
a later date.

Cure Light Wounds*  Range:  touch

Cleric 1  Duration:  permanent

With this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 hit points of damage by
laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.

The reverse form of this spell, cause light wounds, causes 1d6+1
damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll
is required in this case.

Undead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite
fashion; they are injured by cure light wounds and healed by
cause light wounds.

Cure Serious Wounds*

Cleric 4  Range:  touch

Duration:  permanent

This spell works exactly like cure light wounds, save that it
heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The
reverse, cause serious wounds, also works exactly like cause
light wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in
damage.

Darkvision  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 hour/level

The subject receives Darkvision with a range of 60' for the
duration of the spell. (See page 37 for details.)

Death Spell  Range:  240'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a
30' radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within
the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each
creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that
fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more hit dice
or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters,
golems, and any other "creature" that is not truly alive.

Detect Evil  Range:  60'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the
caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items
with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of
evil nature. Normal characters, even "bad" characters, cannot
be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is
detectable. The caster sees the "evil" creatures or objects
with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen
by anyone else.

The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note
that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not "evil,"
and thus not detectable by this spell.

Detect Invisible  Range:  60'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

By means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible
characters, creatures or objects within the given range, seeing
them as translucent shapes.

Detect Magic  Range:  60'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  2 turns

The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or
enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight,
seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster
sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected
by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic
will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the
caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack
penalty of only -2.

Dimension Door  Range:  10'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  instantaneous

The caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself,
or any single target creature within range, to any spot within
200' plus 20' per caster level. The caster or target creature
always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster
visualizes the area or states direction and distance. An
unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being
transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target
creature will be transported also, including another character
or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area
is within a solid object, the spell fails automatically.

Disintegrate  Range:  60'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell causes a thin, green ray to spring from the caster's
pointing finger. Any single creature or object (up to a
10x10x10 foot cube of material) is entirely disintegrated,
leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated
creature’s equipment is unaffected.

A creature that makes a successful save vs. Spells is
unaffected. Only the first creature or object struck can be
affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

Dispel Evil  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures
from the nether planes, hereafter called "evil creatures."

First, the caster gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against
attacks by evil creatures.

Second, the caster can choose to drive an evil creature back to
its home plane by touch (requiring a successful attack roll).
The creature can negate the effects with a successful save vs.
Spells. This use discharges and ends the spell.

Third, with a touch the caster can automatically dispel any one
spell cast by an evil creature. Exception: Spells that can’t be
dispelled by dispel magic also can’t be dispelled by dispel
evil. Saving throws do not apply to this effect. This use
discharges and ends the spell.

The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide;
however, extraplanar creatures that oppose the caster should
almost always qualify.

Dispel Magic  Range:  120'

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3  Duration:  permanent

The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have
been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or
at least their effects) within a cubic area 20' on a side. The
caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or
object, or to affect an area.

If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects
(including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast
upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled.
Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than
the dispel magic caster's level is ended automatically. Those
created by higher level casters may not be canceled; there is a
5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell
effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level
caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a
20% chance of failure.

Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; in particular this
includes any curse, including those created by bestow curse
(the reverse of remove curse) as well as cursed items.

ESP*  Range:  60'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell permits the caster to detect the surface thoughts of
one or more targets within range. The caster must designate a
direction, and then concentrate for a turn in order to "hear"
the thoughts. Each turn the caster may choose to "listen" in a
different direction. The caster may stop listening, then resume
again later, so long as the duration has not expired. The target
creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way.

Rock more than 2 inches thick or a thin coating of lead or gold
will block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this
effect, as are mindless creatures such as golems.

Feeblemind  Range:  180'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  permanent

If the target creature fails a saving throw vs. Spells, its
Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected
creature is unable to cast spells, understand language, or
communicate coherently. The victim does remember who its
friends are and can follow and protect them from harm. The
subject remains in this state until a heal spell is used to
cancel the effect. A target creature that can cast Magic-User
spells suffers a penalty of -4 on its saving throw against this
spell.

Find Traps  Range:  30'

Cleric 2  Duration:  3 turns

This spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both
mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30’ of a
trap, he or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue
aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain
natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls
of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with
the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about
its type or nature.

Find the Path  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a specified destination, be it the way to or
from a locale. The locale can be outdoors or underground. Find
the path works with respect to locations, not objects or
creatures. The location must be on the same plane as the caster
at the time of casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction
that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at
appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions
to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect
secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends
when the destination is reached or the duration expires,
whichever comes first.

Fireball  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

A fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates
with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster
level to every creature within a spherical volume having a 20'
radius. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The
explosion creates almost no pressure.

The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance
and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing,
pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it
impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to
attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at
that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.)
If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow
passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a
missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit the opening,
or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as
lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to
an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
fireball may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its
full volume.

Flesh to Stone*  Range:  30'/level

Magic-User 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes the subject, along with all its carried gear,
to turn into a mindless, inert statue. A saving throw vs.
Petrification is allowed to resist the spell. If the statue
resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if
ever returned to its original state) suffers equivalent damage
or deformities. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by
this spell.

The reverse spell, stone to flesh, acts as a counterspell for
flesh to stone, restoring the creature just as it was when it
was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone that is not
the result of flesh to stone or similar petrification effects
(such as a medusa's gaze).

Floating Disc  Range:  0

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 turns +1/level

This spell creates an invisible, slightly concave circular plane
of force for carrying loads. It is about the size of a shield,
being 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can
hold a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs
about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must be loaded so that the
items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of
course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over
62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other
reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc.
Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide
about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes;
but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain
stable.

The disc floats level to the ground, at about waist high for the
caster. It remains still when within 10' of the caster, and
follows at the caster's movement rate if he or she moves away
from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position
it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10' from
the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc
disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to
the surface beneath.

Fly  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 turn/level

The subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her
normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The
subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed,
with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on
the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only
as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or
cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither
charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her
maximum load.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still
aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 120'
per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in
that amount of time, he or she lands safely. If not, the
subject falls the rest of the distance, taking normal falling
damage. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the
subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is
dispelled.

Geas*  Range:  5' per level

Magic-User 6  Duration:  special

Geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some
service or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to
understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a
geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts
that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to
resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may
choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with
the caster to perform some service.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the
geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the
spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster
level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented
from obeying it) for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of
its ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up
to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3
by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours
after the subject resumes obeying the geas.

A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse
spell, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel
magic does not affect a geas.

Growth of Animals  Range:  60'+10'/level

Cleric 3  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and
eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do
double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its
existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal's
carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save
vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals
will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused
or panicky afterward (at the GM's discretion).

All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged
by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical
properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves
the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its
normal size.

The spell gives no means of command or influence over the
enlarged animals.

Growth of Plants*  Range:  120'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes,
creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become
thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are
determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a
10'x100' area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants
entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or
force a way through. All movement within the affected area is
reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized
creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal
movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for
this spell to take effect.

The reverse form, shrink plants, may be used to render overgrown
areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal
version.

Growth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered,
either by the opposite form or by dispel magic. This spell has
no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.

Hallucinatory Terrain  Range:  400'+40'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  12 turns/level

This spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain
appear like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland
into desert, or the like). This spell requires a full turn to
cast.

The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort
of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within
the area are not hidden or changed in appearance. A save vs.
Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the
creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so.

Haste*  Range:  30'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster
level. The affected creatures move and act twice as quickly as
normal, having double their normal movement rates and making
twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the
spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic
items such as wands, which may still be used just once per
round. Multiple haste or speed effects don’t combine; only
apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

Reversed, haste becomes slow; affected creatures move at half
speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round)
and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target
creatures may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and
slow counter and dispel each other.

Heal*  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

Heal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It
immediately ends any and all of the following adverse
conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness,
confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue,
feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all
but 1d4 of the target's hit points. Heal does not remove
negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score
points.

The reverse spell, harm, deals 10 points of damage per caster
level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level) to the
creature touched. If the creature successfully saves vs.
Spells, half damage is done.

If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm;
likewise, harm affects undead like heal.

Hold Monster  Range:  180'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  2d8 turns

This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects
any living creature that fails its save vs. Spells.

Hold Person  Range:  180'

Cleric 2, Magic-User 3  Duration:  2d8 turns

This spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human
or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will
not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware,
and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including
speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect.
The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her
save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures
in the group may be affected.

A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and
falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown.

Hold Portal  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter
of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as
if it were securely closed and normally locked. A knock spell
or a successful dispel magic spell can negate a hold portal
spell.

Ice Storm  Range:  300'+30'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 round

This spell causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1
full round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a
20' radius around the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells
will reduced damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical
volume of 40', so creatures higher than that distance above the
target spot are unaffected. A –20% penalty applies to each
Listen roll made within the ice storm’s effect, and all land
movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the
duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other
than the damage dealt). Any creature naturally resistant to
cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its
save).

Insect Plague  Range:  300'+30'/level

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels,
to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level. See Insect Swarm in
the Monsters section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms
must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one
other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous
area). The caster may summon the locust swarms so that they
share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any
creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after
being summoned.

Invisibility  Range:  touch

Magic-User 2  Duration:  special

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from
sight, including Darkvision. If the recipient is a creature
carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If the spell is cast on
someone else, neither the caster nor his or her allies can see
the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or
employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become
visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing
or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes
invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the
effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of
an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10
feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not
magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the
recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts any
spell. Actions (other than spellcasting) directed at unattended
objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not
an attack. The spell lasts at most 24 hours.

Invisibility 10' Radius  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell
confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the
recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the
recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves
as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out
of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area
after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected
creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the
invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient
attacks, the invisibility sphere ends for all affected
creatures.

Invisible Stalker  Range:  0

Magic-User 6  Duration:  special

The caster summons an invisible stalker to do his or her bidding
(see the Monsters section, below, for details). The spell
persists until dispel evil is cast on the creature, it is
slain, or the task is fulfilled. The GM is advised to review
the monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is
used, as they may not always be reliable servants.

Knock  Range:  30'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  special

The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard
locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or
trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles,
or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can
be opened). If used to open a wizard locked door, the spell
does not remove the wizard lock but simply suspends its
functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not
relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not
raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor
will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can undo
a single means of preventing access.

Levitate  Range:  touch

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

Levitate allows the caster to move himself or herself, another
creature, or an object up and down as desired. A creature must
be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or
possessed by a willing creature. The caster can mentally direct
the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round,
by concentration. The caster cannot move the recipient
horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of
a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move
laterally (generally at half its normal land speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a weapon finds itself
increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 attack
penalty, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5.
A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin
again at –1.

Light*  Range:  120'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  6 + level turns

This spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates
a 30' radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 30')
around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if
cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.
Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.

Reversed, light becomes darkness, creating an area of darkness
just as described above. This darkness does not block out
Darkvision, but does negate light sources.

A light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness
spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa).

Either version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by
means of casting it on the target's ocular organs. The target is
allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if
the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A light
or darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of
effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the
victim).

Lightning Bolt  Range:  50'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that
deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level to each
creature within its area. A save vs. Spells for half damage is
allowed. The bolt begins at the caster's fingertips and extends
to the range given. The caster may choose to limit the range of
the spell, but the minimum range is 60 feet. The lightning bolt
passes through an area 5' wide, arcing and jumping, so that,
while it is not actually 5' wide, for game purposes treat it as
if it is so.

The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects
in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such
as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused
to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range
permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward
the caster, or in a random direction at the GM's option.
Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take
additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.

Locate Object  Range:  360'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a
well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search
for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is
located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot
specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that
particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell
is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures
cannot be found by this spell.

Lower Water  Range:  360'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by
as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1
inch). The water is lowered within a more or less square-shaped
depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level.
In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep
ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and
similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them
unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the
spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based
creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (the reverse of
haste); a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the
effect. The spell has no effect on other creatures.

Magic Jar  Range:  60'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

By casting magic jar, the caster places his or her soul in a gem
or large crystal within spell range (known as the magic jar),
leaving the body lifeless. The caster may then attempt to take
control of a nearby living creature within spell range, forcing
its soul into the magic jar. The caster may move back to the jar
(thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to
possess another body. The spell ends when the caster's soul
returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty.

To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and
the caster must know where it is, though he or she does not
need to be able to see it. When the caster transfers his or her
soul upon casting, the caster's body is, as near as anyone can
tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body
would.

Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by
protection from evil or a similar ward. The subject is allowed
a save vs. Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host
leaves the caster's life force in the magic jar, and that
target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration
of the spell.

If the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the
host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic
jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities
(including spellcasting ability). The body retains its
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural
abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to
make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access
to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body.

If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is
broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage): If the jar
is in range of the caster's body, the caster's spirit returns to
its body. Otherwise, the caster's spirit departs (the caster
dies). In either case, the spell ends.

If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by dispel
evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the
caster's spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit
returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the
same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the
magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit
departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar (and departs),
and the host's body dies.

If the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken:
If the jar is in range of the host's body, the caster's spirit
departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell
ends. Otherwise, the host's spirit departs, and the caster's
spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell
has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the
caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending
the spell.

In any case where the spell ends with the caster's body
unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.

Magic Missile  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 1  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from
the caster's fingertip and strike its target, dealing 1d6+1
points of damage. The missile strikes unerringly, even if the
target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total
concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out.
Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every three caster levels beyond 1st, an additional missile
is fired -- two at 4th level, three at 7th, four at 10th, and
the maximum of five missiles at 13th level or higher. If the
caster fires multiple missiles, he or she can target a single
creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only
one creature. Targets must be designated before damage is
rolled.

Magic Mouth  Range:  30'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted
mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time
a specified event occurs. The message, which may be up to three
words per caster level long, can be in any language known by
the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at
any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the
caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use
command words or activate magical effects. It does, however,
move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon
a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to
speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock,
or any other object.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled
according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands
can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only
visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what
appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them.
Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical
darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical
silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed
to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken
word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or
audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or
class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a
6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to
triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth
can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in
line of sight or within hearing distance.

Massmorph  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 hour/level

With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man sized (or smaller)
creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are
natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest,
stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern,
etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120'
radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those
creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only
if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include
himself or herself among the affected creatures.

Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing
through the area for so long as they remain still. If an
affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is
dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still
continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he
or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also
be ended by dispel magic.

Mirror Image  Range:  self

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster.
The images move through each other as well as the real caster
more or less constantly, making it impossible for most
creatures to determine which is real. A total of 1d4 images
plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images
total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and
remain in a cluster around him or her. The figments mimic the
caster's actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions,
levitate, and so on, just as the caster does.

Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will
always hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image
destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not;
likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will
destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Figments always look
exactly like the caster; for instance, if the caster is
subjected to a fireball, all figments will appear to be injured
just as the caster was.

Neutralize Poison*  Range:  touch

Cleric 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or
object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional
effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by
poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1
hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.)
the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes poison. The caster must make a
successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target
must save vs. Poison or die. The caster's touch remains
poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged
(i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

Passwall  Range:  30'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  3 turns

Passwall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone
walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The
passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep
per three caster levels above 9th (20 feet at 12th, 30 feet
deep at 15th, 40 feet deep at 18th). If the wall’s thickness is
more than the depth of the passage created, then a single
passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall
spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick
walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, dispel magic, or
caster's choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out
the nearest exit.

Phantasmal Force  Range:  180'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  concentration

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature,
or force, as visualized by the caster, up to a maximum size of
20'x20'x20'. The illusion does not create sound, smell,
texture, or temperature. The caster can move the image within
the limits of the size of the effect. The image persists so
long as the caster concentrates upon it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they
will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in
combat. If used to simulate an attack spell, a successful save
vs. Spells will allow victims to avoid all damage. Damage done
by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this spell is not real;
those "killed" or otherwise apparently disabled will wake up
uninjured (at least from this spell) after 2d8 rounds. The
illusory damage done will be equivalent to the normal damage
for any attack form simulated.

Polymorph Other  Range:  30'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell allows the caster to change one target into another
form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit
dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike
polymorph self, the transformed target also gains the
behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special,
supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in
addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such.
If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target
may not remember its former life.

The target creature will have the same number of hit points it
previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as
noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a
doppleganger can revert to its natural form in one round.

Unwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are
not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the
creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or
her original form.

Polymorph Self  Range:  self

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to change into another form of
living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than
the caster's level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or
gaseous form. If slain, the caster reverts to his or her
original form.

The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the
new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she
also gains all physical attacks possessed by the form but does
not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities.
Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the
caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she could use the
dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the
dragon's breath.

The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of
ability, or may choose to end the spell whenever he or she
desires (up to one hour per level, of course).

Projected Image  Range:  240'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  6 turns

This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster.
The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like
the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions
(including speech). Any further spells cast seem to originate
from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight
between the caster and his or her illusory self must be
maintained or the spell ends. Dimension door, teleport, or any
similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image,
as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat.

Protection from Evil*  Range:  touch

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from
mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a
magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The
barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on
saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects
created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is
left to the individual GM to decide.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded
creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise
mental control over the creature (including charm spells or
effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from
targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect
for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the
protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting
control does, the would-be controller would then be able to
command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps
out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in
place before the spell is cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures
(regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the
natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the
creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded
creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures
ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to
force the barrier against the blocked creature.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions
in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are
kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.

Protection from Evil 10' Radius*

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3  Range:  touch

Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell functions exactly as protection from evil, but with a
10' radius rather than a 1' radius. All within the radius
receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or
who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as
well.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good 10' radius,
and functions exactly as the reversed form of protection from
evil, except that it covers a 10' radius around the target
rather than the normal 1' radius.

Protection from Normal Missiles

Magic-User 3  Range:  self

Duration:  1 turn/level

The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical
missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or
other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows,
sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be
fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows
count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.

Purify Food and Water

Cleric 1  Range:  10'

Duration:  instantaneous

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise
contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and
drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay
or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of
significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell
has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.

Quest*  Range:  5'/level

Cleric 5  Duration:  special

Quest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some
service or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to
understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a
quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts
that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to
resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may
choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with
the caster to perform some service.

The affected creature must follow the given instructions until
the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell
remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A
clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours,
it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.

A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse
spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of
the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel
magic does not affect a quest spell.

Raise Dead*  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  permanent

This spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or
humanoid. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead
for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the
subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the
subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not
work.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell
loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently
(i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an
actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience
points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st
level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would
reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This
level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any
means.

Also note, a character who died with spells prepared has none
prepared upon being raised.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its
current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in
the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and
curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and
repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to
be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still
missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the
dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any
way by this spell.

A creature which has become undead can’t be raised by this
spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell
cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

The reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the
creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human,
demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If
the saving throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the
victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell
in combat.

Read Languages  Range:  0

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any
written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:

In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any
number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode
lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one
book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.

In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one
scroll (other than a spell scroll; for instance, a protection
scroll or a treasure map); this mode is permanent.

The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in
any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts
the caster doesn't otherwise have the ability to understand.
Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one
living creature that can read the given language somewhere on
the same plane.

Regenerate  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers,
toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of
multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow
back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is
complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and
touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for
the regeneration to complete.

This spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no
effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).

Reincarnate  Range:  touch

Magic-User 6  Duration:  permanent

With this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or
humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death
occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell
and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the
subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not
work.

Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature
the character becomes:

d%

Incarnation

01–02

Bugbear

03–17

Dwarf

18–28

Elf

29

30–39

Human

Kobold

Troglodyte

100

Other (GM's choice)

Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all
physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of
the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of
the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but
the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the
character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell
creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to
inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes
one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is
reincarnated.

A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life
and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's
ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new
form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.)
The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a
real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to
magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total
from the character's original hit point total; this is the new
form's hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a
hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by
2. (If this reduction would put its Constitution at 0 or lower,
it can’t be reincarnated).

A character that has been turned into an undead creature or
killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this
spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be
reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has
died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with
its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural
armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like,
but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new
form.

[-- Image: graphics47 --]Remove Curse*  Range:  30'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 4  Duration:  permanent

Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or
a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a
cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell
typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed
item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may
not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a
caster of a certain level or higher.

The reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to
place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to
resist. The caster must choose one of the following three
effects:

–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).

–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.

Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally;
otherwise, it takes no action.

The caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should
be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus
bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a
remove curse spell.

Remove Fear*  Range:  touch (120')

Cleric 1  Duration:  instantaneous

(2 turns)

This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target
creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it
is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a
bonus of +1 per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, cause fear, causes one target
creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails
to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or
more hit dice are immune to this effect.

Resist Cold  Range:  touch

Cleric 1  Duration:  1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold.
Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate
clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more
significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the
affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all
damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).

Resist Fire  Range:  touch

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and
heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is
ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat
or fire (such as a fireball), the affected creature gains a
bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks
is reduced by half (round up).

Restoration  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell restores negative levels to a creature who has
suffered energy drain. See the rules for Energy Drain (in the
Encounter section) for details.

Restoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as
described for the spell raise dead).

Shield  Range:  self

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 rds.+1/level

Shield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force
that hovers in front of the caster. It negates magic missile
attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster's Armor
Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The
Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from
behind the caster, but magic missiles are warded off from all
directions.

Silence 15' Radius  Range:  360'

Cleric 2  Duration:  2 rounds/level

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within
a 15' radius around the target. All sound is stopped:
Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise
whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The
spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect
stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can
be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the
creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a
save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another
creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives
a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense
against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.

Sleep  Range:  90'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 rounds/level

This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a
magical slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not
affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell
(within the given range, of course), and those creatures within
30' of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the
area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the
effect.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an
affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not
affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures,
and such creatures in the area of effect are ignored.

When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake
up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and
the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue
sleeping normally, at the GM's option.

Speak with Animals  Range:  special

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 turn/4 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal
(normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is
in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster
may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will,
once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction
or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should
be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals
are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones
make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward
the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.

Speak with Monsters  Range:  special

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 turn/5 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster
that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The
caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at
will, once per round. Others able to understand the language
spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to
understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s
reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more
intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while
less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is
friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or
service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and
undead are unaffected by this spell.

Speak with Plants  Range:  20'

Cleric 4  Duration:  1 turn

The caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal
plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its
surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or
recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer
questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The
spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards
the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate
freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance
to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse
and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other
monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it
may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal
plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally
perform “services” other than to answer questions.

Speak with Dead  Range:  10'

Cleric 3  Duration:  3 rounds/level

This spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a
corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster
puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster
levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires.
The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew
during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers
are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the
past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell
on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but
the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged
corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct
answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at
all.

This spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person
(whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted
knowledge “stored” in the corpse. The partially animated body
retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and
thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had
while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information.
Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned.

This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an
undead creature.

Spiritual Hammer  Range:  30'

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into
existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range
once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike,
+1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the
caster’s normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and
thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by
magic weapon. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the
Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it,
the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed
by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod
of cancellation will dispel it.

Sticks to Snakes  Range:  120'

Cleric 4  Duration:  6 turns

This spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice
worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster
levels. (See the Monsters section for details on types of
snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When
slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to
their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted
staves cannot be affected.

Striking  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6
points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on
each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It
provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the
spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be
affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such
a monster, however.

Telekinesis  Range:  self

Magic-User 5  Duration:  3 turns

This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by
concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds
per caster level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A
creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds
or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray. In
order to use this power, the caster must maintain
concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no
running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If
concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power
may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the
effect is allowed a new saving throw.

Teleport  Range:  self

Magic-User 5  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell instantly transports the caster to a designated
destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster
level. Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring
along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100
pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with
all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although
creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another,
with at least one of those creatures in contact with the
caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs.
Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an
attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a
creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession
from being teleported.

The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout
of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more
likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong
magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even
impossible.

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the
table below. Refer to the following information for definitions
of the terms on the table.

Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has
been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a
place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be
seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as
scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one
hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more
than once but with which he or she is not very familiar.
“Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once,
possibly using magic.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if
the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that
no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to
no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.

On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.

Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away
from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target
is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The
direction off target is determined randomly.

Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that’s visually or
thematically similar to the target area. This means that the
caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no
such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply
fails instead.

Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster
have gotten “scrambled.” Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then
reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these
rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the
characters take more damage and must reroll.

True Seeing  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things
as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and
magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact
locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through
normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or
objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true
form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range
of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.

True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no
way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate
concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In
addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with
known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal
ball or in conjunction with clairvoyance.

Ventriloquism  Range:  60'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell allows the caster to cause his or her voice to sound
from someplace else within range, for example, from a dark
alcove or statue.

Wall of Fire  Range:  180'

Cleric 5, Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 round/level

(or special)

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs
into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster,
sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to
creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those
beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage
when it appears and on the caster's turn each round to all
creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points
+1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature
passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead
creatures.

The wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20' in length per
caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5' per caster
level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if
desired. The wall may be up to 20' tall (as desired by the
caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).

If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures
are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall;
a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that
damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10' of the wall.

The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within
reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it
with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her
option.

Wall of Iron  Range:  90'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into
being. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square
section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so
desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding
nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall
cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a
creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat
plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available
space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the
ground.

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a
proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the
thickness halved the area. The wall may not be made less than
one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically
resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so
that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures
beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction
if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction
rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13
Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or
several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional
Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is
sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the
falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray
(with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or
smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The
wall cannot crush larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation,
and other natural phenomena.

Wall of Stone  Range:  15' per level

Magic-User 5  Duration:  permanent

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining
rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square
section, 1' thick, per caster level. The caster can double the
wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be
conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
another object.

The caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he or
she desires. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest
upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be
solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a
chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is
more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This
requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. The wall can be
crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so
forth by likewise reducing the area.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and
chipping.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within
or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can
hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with
successful saves vs. Death Ray.

Water Breathing  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  2 hours/level

The affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the
duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. The spell
does not make creatures unable to breathe air.

Web  Range:  10' per level

Magic-User 2  Duration:  2 turns/level

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands,
filling a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight
10'x10' cubes). The strands are similar to spider webs but far
larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or
more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web
collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation,
the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes,
up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume.
The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she
wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among
the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the
attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected
area will.

Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a
save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is
entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is
reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled
creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks;
whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide.
Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web,
it will be able to act normally again.

If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or
perform any other physical action (even speech is impossible).
Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice)
may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures
are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given
above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength
of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the
duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the
webs alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will
spread to adjacent 10' cubes each round until all the webbing
is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All
creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage
from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free
afterwards.

Wizard Eye  Range:  240'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  6 turns

With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical "eye"
through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but
otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created
in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240' away,
and thereafter can move at a rate of 40' per round as directed
by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240' feet away
from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass
through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a
normal human's eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1
inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.

Wizard Lock  Range:  20'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  Permanent

A wizard lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically
locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own wizard lock
without affecting it, as can any Magic-User 3 or more levels
higher than the caster of the wizard lock; otherwise, a door or
object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in
or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell.

Word of Recall  Range:  self (special)

Cleric 6  Duration:  instantaneous

Word of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her
sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must
designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and
it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival
is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The
caster can be transported any distance within a plane but
cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along
objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds
per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all
objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures
to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at
least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).

An unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall.
Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its
possession from being teleported.

PART 4: THE ADVENTURE

Time and Scale

Time in the dungeon is measured in game turns, which are
(approximately) 10 minutes long. When combat begins, the time
scale changes to combat rounds, which are (approximately) 10
seconds long. Thus, there are 60 combat rounds per game turn.

Distances in the dungeon are measured in feet. Outdoors, change
all distance measurements (movement, range, etc.) to yards (so
100' becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for
spells, for instance) normally remain in feet.

Dungeon Adventures

Carrying Capacity

Normal Human, Elven and Dwarvish player characters are able to
carry up to 60 pounds and still be considered lightly loaded,
or up to 150 pounds and be considered heavily loaded. Halflings
may carry up to 50 pounds and be considered lightly loaded, or
up to 100 pounds and be heavily loaded. Note that armor for
Halfling characters is about one-quarter as heavy as armor for
the other races.

These figures are affected by Strength; each +1 value adds 10%
to the capacity of the character, while each -1 deducts 20%.
Thus, carrying capacities for normal characters are as shown
below (rounded to the nearest 5 pounds for convenience):

Dwarf, Elf, Human

The carrying capacities of various domesticated animals are
given in the Monsters section, in the entry for each type of
animal.

Movement and Encumbrance

The movement rate of a character or creature is expressed as the
number of feet it can move per combat round. The normal player
character races can all move 40' per round. When exploring a
dungeon, time is expressed in turns, as explained above; normal
movement per turn is 3 times the movement rate per round.

This may seem slow, but this rate of movement includes such
things as drawing maps, watching out for traps and monsters
(though they may still surprise the party), etc. In a combat
situation, on the other hand, everyone is moving around
swiftly, and such things as drawing maps are not important.

A character's movement rate is adjusted by his or her
Encumbrance (the load he or she is carrying) as follows:

Armor Type

Lightly Loaded

Heavily Loaded

No Armor or Magic Leather

40'

30'

Leather Armor or Magic Metal

30'

20'

Metal Armor

20'

10'

Count the weight of armor worn when calculating encumbrance,
because armor counts both for bulk and restrictiveness as well
as for weight. Magic armor counts for its full weight but is
not as bulky and restrictive as normal armor.

Mapping

In any dungeon expedition, making maps is important. Generally
one player will do this, drawing a map on graph paper as the
Game Master describes each room or corridor. Absolute accuracy
is usually not possible; the main thing is to ensure that the
party can find its way back out of the dungeon.

Light

A torch or lantern will provide light covering a 30' radius; dim
light will extend about 20' further. Normal torches burn for
1d4+4 turns, while a flask of oil in a lantern will burn for
18+1d6 turns. A candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with
dim light extending 5' further. In general, taper candles such
as are used for illumination will burn about 3 turns per inch
of height.

Darkvision

Some character races, and almost all monsters, have Darkvision.
This gives them the ability to see even in total darkness.
Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal
sight. Darkvision does not grant one the ability to see in
magical darkness. The range of Darkvision is typically either
30' or 60'; if not given for a particular creature, assume the
60' range.

Darkvision is totally ineffective in any light greater than
moonlight.

Doors

A stuck door can be opened on a roll of 1 on 1d6; add the
character's Strength bonus to the range, so that a character
with a bonus of +2 can open a stuck door on a roll of 1-3 on
1d6.

Locked doors can be forced by rolling the same range, but on
1d10. Metal bars can sometimes be bent on a roll of this range
on 1d20.

Traps

Dungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including
spear-throwers, covered pits, etc. The GM will decide what is
required to trigger a trap, and what happens when the trap is
triggered. In general, there must be some way to avoid or
reduce the effect of the trap being sprung. For instance, a
save vs. Death Ray is often used to avoid falling into a
covered pit (with Dexterity bonus added), while spear-throwers,
automated crossbows, and the like are sometimes treated as if
they were monsters (attacking vs. the victim's Armor Class at
some given attack bonus).

Normal characters have a chance equal to a roll of 1 on 1d6 to
detect a trap if a search for one is made. Note that this is
about a 16.7% chance; Thieves have a special ability to find
and remove traps, which supersedes this roll, as does the
stonework trap-finding ability of Dwarves. A Dwarven Thief is a
special case; apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher.
In all cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10'
square area. A single character may only effectively search a
given area for traps once, even if the character has more than
one trap-detection roll “type” allowed (such as the Dwarven
Thief above).

Trap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely magical
in nature; on the other hand, in such cases Magic-Users and/or
Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at the given 1 in
1d6 chance, at the Game Master's option.

Secret Doors

Under normal conditions, searching for secret doors takes one
turn per character per 10' of wall searched. A secret door is
found on a roll of 1 on 1d6; characters with 15 or higher
Intelligence succeed on a roll of 1-2. Also, as noted
previously, Elves add 1 to the range automatically. The GM may
create secret doors that are more difficult (or easier) to
detect at his or her option.

Multiple characters searching for secret doors ensures that any
such will eventually be found; however, if the first and second
searchers fail, the next searcher must take two turns to search,
and all subsequent searches of the area require an hour.

Note that finding a secret door does not grant understanding of
how it works. The GM may require additional rolls or other
actions to be taken before the door can be opened.

Dungeon Survival

As described in the Equipment section, above, normal characters
must consume one day's worth of rations (or equivalent food)
and a minimum of one quart of water per day.

Failure to consume enough food does not significantly affect a
character for the first two days, after which he or she loses 1
hit point per day. Furthermore, at that point the character
loses the ability to heal wounds normally, though magic will
still work. Eating enough food for a day (over the course of
about a day, not all at once) restores the ability to heal, and
the character will recover lost hit points at the normal rate.

Inadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a single
day without water, the character loses 1d4 hit points, and will
lose an additional 1d4 hit points per day thereafter; healing
ability is lost when the first die of damage is rolled.

Wilderness Adventures

Wilderness Movement Rates

Movement rates when traveling in the wilderness are related
directly to encounter movement rates, as shown on the table
below:

Encounter Movement

(Feet per Round)

Wilderness Movement

(Miles per Day)

Naturally, any group traveling together moves at the rate of the
slowest member.

Overland Travel

The movement rates shown on the table above are figured based on
an 8 hour day of travel through open, clear terrain. The terrain
type will alter the rate somewhat, as shown on this table:

Terrain

Adjustment

Jungle, Mountains, Swamp

x1/3

Desert, Forest, Hills

x1/2

Clear, Plains, Trail

x2/3

Road (Paved)

x1

Characters may choose to perform a forced march, traveling 12
hours per day. If this is done, add an additional 50% to the
distance traveled. Each day of forced march performed after the
first inflicts 1d6 damage on the characters (and their animals,
if any). A save vs. Death Ray with Constitution bonus applied
is allowed to avoid this damage, but after this save is failed
once, it is not rolled again for that character or creature. A
day spent resting “restarts” the progression.

Waterborne Travel

Travel by water may be done in a variety of boats or ships; see
the table in the Vehicles section for details. Travel distances
are based on a 12 hour day of travel, rather than the usual 8
hours per day given above. Note that sailed ships may travel 24
hours per day (if a qualified navigator is aboard), and so may
be able to cover twice the normal distance per day of travel.
This is in addition to the multiplier given below. If the ship
stops each night, as is done by some vessels traveling along a
coastline as well as those vessels having less than the minimum
number of regular crewmen on board, the two-times multiplier
does not apply.

Movement of sailed ships varies depending on weather conditions,
as shown on the following table. Sailing movement modifiers
shown apply when sailing with the wind; sailing against the
wind involves tacking (called “zigzagging” by landlubbers)
which reduces movement rates two rows on the table (from
Moderate Breeze to Very Light Breeze, for instance).

given rowing movement rate.

Very Strong Winds: Sailing against the wind (tacking) is not
possible.

Gale: Sailing against the wind is not possible, and ships
exposed to a gale may be damaged or sunk; apply 2d8 points of
damage to any such ship, per hour sailed.

Traveling by Air

When traveling by air, overland movement rates are doubled, and
all terrain effects are ignored. Most flying creatures and
devices can ascend at half the given forward movement rate.
Most winged creatures must maintain at least one-third normal
forward movement in order to remain airborne; however, devices
such as flying carpets generally do not have to do this.

Becoming Lost

Adventurers following roads, trails, rivers, streams, or other
obvious landmarks are unlikely to become lost; however, when
the party strikes out into trackless forest, windblown desert,
etc. they may become lost. Secretly roll a save vs. Death Ray,
adjusted by the Wisdom of the party leader (i.e. whichever
player character seems to be leading). (Alternately, an Ability
Roll against Wisdom may be rolled, if that optional rule is in
use.) The GM must determine the effects of a failed roll.

Retainers, Specialists and Mercenaries

Player characters will sometimes want or need to hire NPCs
(Non-Player Characters) to work for them. There are several
categories of NPCs available for hire, as follows:

Retainers

A retainer is a close associate of his employer. Retainers are
hired for a share of treasure (typically at least 15% of the
employer's income) plus support costs (weapons, armor, rations,
and basic equipment provided by the employer). Retainers are
typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks;
in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will
generally accompany a player character into a dungeon, lair, or
ruin.

Hiring a retainer is more involved than hiring other NPCs.
First, the player character must advertise for a retainer,
typically by hiring a crier, posting notices in public places,
or asking (and possibly paying) NPCs such as innkeepers or
taverners to direct potential retainers to the player
character. It is up to the Game Master to rule on what must be
done, and how successful these activities are.

If the player character is successful, one or more NPCs will
present themselves to be interviewed. The Game Master should
play out the interview with the player, and after all offers
have been made and all questions asked, a reaction roll should
be made. To check the potential retainer's reaction, the Game
Master rolls 2d6 and adds the player character's Charisma
bonus. In addition, the Game Master may apply any adjustments
he or she feels are appropriate (a bonus of +1 for
higher-than-average pay or the offer of a magic item such as a
sword +1, or a penalty if the player character offers poor
terms). The roll is read as follows:

Adjusted Die Roll

Result

2 or less

Refusal, -1 on further rolls

3-5

Refusal

6-8

Try again

9-11

Acceptance

12 or more

Acceptance, +1 to Loyalty

Refusal, -1 on further rolls means that all further reaction
rolls made by that player character in the given town or region
will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by the NPC
to his fellows. If the player character tries again in a
different town, the penalty does not apply.

If a Try again result is rolled, the potential retainer is
reluctant, and needs more convincing; the player character must
“sweeten” the deal in order to get an additional roll, such as
by offering more pay, a magic item, etc. If the player character
makes no better offer, treat Try again as a Refusal result.

Loyalty: All retainers have a Loyalty score, which is generally
7 plus the employer's Charisma bonus (or penalty). The Loyalty
score is used just as the Morale score of monsters or
mercenaries is used, but in addition the Game Master should
roll a Loyalty check at the end of each adventure (after
treasure is divided) to determine if the retainer will remain
with the player character. If a Loyalty check roll is a natural
2, the Loyalty of the retainer increases by +1 point. Note that
a Loyalty of 12 is fanatical... the retainer will do virtually
anything the player character asks, and never flee in combat.
However, the Game Master should still apply penalties when the
player character instructs the retainer to do something which
appears very risky, making a failed check possible.

Maximum Number of Retainers: A player character may hire at most
4 retainers, plus the character's Charisma bonus (or penalty).
Any attempts to hire more than this number of retainers will be
met with automatic refusals.

Level of Retainers: Normally, potential retainers will be
one-half the level of the employer (or less). So, a first level
character cannot hire retainers, second level PCs can only hire
first level characters, and so on. Of course, there is no way
for the retainers to directly know the level of the PC
employer, nor for the employer to know the level of the
potential retainer; but the Game Master should usually enforce
this rule for purposes of game balance. It shouldn't be
surprising that first level characters can't hire retainers, as
they have no reputation to speak of yet.

Experience for Retainers: Unlike other hired NPCs, retainers do
gain experience just as other adventurers do; however, as they
are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a
share of XP is allocated to each retainer. See Character
Advancement, below, for an example.

Specialists

Specialists are NPCs who may be hired by player characters to
perform various tasks. Specialists do not go on adventures or
otherwise risk their lives fighting monsters, disarming traps,
or any of the other dangerous things player characters and
retainers may do. Rather, specialists perform services the
player characters usually can't perform for themselves, like
designing and erecting castles, training animals, or operating
ships.

A player character is limited in the number of specialists he or
she can hire only by the amount of money they cost; Charisma
does not affect this.

Alchemist: 1,000 gp per month. These characters are generally
hired for one of two reasons: to make potions, or to assist a
Magic-User with magical research.

An alchemist can produce a potion, given the required materials
and a sample or a written formula for the potion, in the same
time and for the same cost as a Magic-User. They may also
research new potions, but at twice the cost in time and
materials as a Magic-User.

Alternately, a Magic-User seeking to create certain magic items
may employ an alchemist as an assistant. In this case, the
alchemist adds 15% to the Magic-User's chance of success.

Note: Details for the creation of magic items are not given in
this book; the Game Master is encouraged to create his or her
own rules for this purpose.

Animal Trainer: 250 to 750 gp per month. Characters wishing to
ride hippogriffs or employ carnivorous apes as guards will need
the assistance of an animal trainer. The lowest cost above is
for an average animal trainer, able to train one type of
“normal” animal such as carnivorous apes; those able to train
more than one sort of animal, or to train monstrous creatures
such as hippogriffs, are more expensive to hire. The Game
Master must decide how long it takes to train an animal; in
some cases, animal training may take years, a fact the player
characters may find inconvenient. A single animal trainer can
train and manage no more than 5 animals at a time, though in
most cases once an animal is fully trained, if it is put into
service right away the animal trainer won't be needed to handle
it any longer.

Armorer (or Weaponsmith): 100 to 500 gp per month. Characters
hiring mercenaries, or having armed and armored followers to
take care of, will need the services of an armorer. In general,
for every 50 Fighters employed, one armorer is required to care
for their gear. The armorer's equipment is not included in the
costs given above, but the cost to maintain his apprentices is
included; most such characters will have 1d4 apprentices
assisting.

Higher priced armorers or weaponsmiths may be hired to assist in
making magic weapons or armor; in this case, the character hired
will be a specialist, an expert in making one particular type of
armor or weapon, and will command a higher price (as shown
above). Such characters will rarely agree to do the mundane
work of maintaining weapons and armor for a military unit.

Engineer: 750 gp per month. Any player character wishing to
build a fortress, a ship, or any other mundane construction
will need an engineer. Large projects may require several
engineers, at the GM's option.

Savant: 1,500 gp per month. Savants are experts in ancient and
obscure knowledge. Many savants have particular interests in
very limited or focused areas (i.e. “Elven migrations of the
2nd age”), but even these will know or have access to a lot of
facts. The listed cost is the minimum required to maintain a
savant with his library, collections, etc. If the savant's
patron asks a difficult question, there may be additional costs
for materials or research to answer it.

Ship's Crew: Special. A crew for a waterborne vessel involves
several types of characters. At the very least, a complement of
sailors and a Captain are needed; rowers will be needed aboard
galleys, and a Navigator is required aboard ships going out of
sight of land.

Costs per month for each sort of character are given below:

Seaman Type

Cost

Captain

300 gp

Navigator

200 gp

Sailor

10 gp

Rower

3 gp

In general, all such characters are normal men, and are not
armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or
shortswords. Player characters with appropriate backgrounds may
act as Captain, but unless experienced as a ship's captain, they
will have difficulty commanding respect from the regular sailors
(lower the Morale of such regular sailors by -2 if led by an
inexperienced Captain).

Mercenaries

Mercenaries are hired warriors. They are generally hired in
units as small as platoons: 32 to 48 Fighters, divided into two
to four squads of soldiers; each squad is led by a corporal,
while the platoon is led by a lieutenant plus a sergeant.
Platoons are joined together into companies, each generally
consisting of two to five platoons and led by a captain with a
sergeant as his assistant (called a first sergeant).

As mercenaries are almost always veteran troops, the average
mercenary is a 1st level Fighter; 10% of corporals and 50% of
sergeants are 2nd level. A mercenary lieutenant will generally
be 2nd level, while a captain will be 2nd to 4th level and his
first sergeant will be 2nd or 3rd level. Larger mercenary units
will usually be beyond the reach of player characters until they
have reached fairly high levels, and are left to the Game Master
to detail.

Mercenaries will virtually never go into a dungeon, lair, or
ruin, at least until it has been fully cleared. Rather, they
are used in outdoor military engagements; high level player
characters may hire mercenaries to defend or help defend their
castles or other holdings.

Statistics are given below for the most common sorts of
mercenaries; the statistics are for first level characters, and
should be adjusted when higher level characters are indicated
(as given above). In particular, multiply the given cost of
each mercenary by his or her level. Listed costs are in gold
pieces per month.

Character Advancement

Experience Points

Experience points are given for monsters defeated, and for other
challenges as the GM sees fit. The following table provides XP
values for monsters. Where a monster has both a character level
and hit dice given, use the larger value as the monster's level.
Non-combat challenges may be assigned a level, or a flat XP
value assigned, as the GM wishes.

If asterisks appear after the hit dice listing for a monster,
each asterisk adds the special ability bonus once; for example,
a creature with a hit dice figure of 2** is worth 125 XP.

For monsters with more than 19 hit dice, add 750 XP to the XP
Value and 25 XP to the Special Ability Bonus per additional hit
die.

After tallying the XP earned in a given adventure, the amount
should be divided by the number of adventurers. As described
above, each retainer should receive a one-half share; so a
group with four player characters and a retainer is counted as
having 4½ members. If 2,000 XP are earned by this group, one
share is 444 XP, and the retainer receives 222 XP.

No character may advance more than one level due to the
experience points from a single adventure. For example, Barthal
the Thief is 1st level and has 1,000 XP before going on an
adventure; during the adventure, he earns 2,000 more XP (an
amazing feat). This would make his total 3,000 XP, and he would
be a 3rd level Thief. This is not allowed; instead, he advances
to 2,499 XP, one short of the amount required for 3rd level,
and starts his next adventure at 2nd level.

PART 5: THE ENCOUNTER

I raised my shield to fend off one of the monsters, and hewed at
another with my sword, but I missed my first swing. Morningstar
swung at one of the monsters and struck it, but her sword did
the bony thing little harm. I saw that Apoqulis still stood by
the door; of Barthal there was no sign. Fortunately, Apoqulis
also had a torch.

Apoqulis raised his holy symbol and called in a loud voice, "In
the name of Tah, begone!" To my surprise, several of the
monsters turned as if afraid and ran out the door, disappearing
into the gloom. Unfortunately this left quite a few of them
still in the room.

Even as I saw all this I continued to hack at the monsters. It
took two good blows to down the first one; it appeared that
Morningstar was having similar trouble with the monsters. Then
one of the skeletons hit her, just a minor wound, but still I
felt good that I had invested my part of the proceeds of our
last excursion in a suit of plate mail armor; I was shrugging
off blows that would have harmed me were I still wearing chain
mail.

To my surprise, I saw Apoqulis down one of the monsters in a
single blow, then do the same to another in his very next
strike. His mace seemed to be much more effective against the
monsters than our swords. As I finally managed to down a second
skeleton, I heard a high-pitched yell... it was Barthal, a
little ways down the hallway, and he was throwing something.

There was a sound of glass breaking, and I felt a splash of
water on my face. Several of the skeletons began to smoke, and
then one of them fell in a heap. Holy water, I decided, but I
didn't have time to think about it. I just kept hacking at the
skeletons.

By the time they were all gone, I had taken a wound, and
Morningstar had taken a second. We had one potion of healing
left of those that Apoqulis' temple had given us; Morningstar
told me to drink it, but I could tell she was in worse shape
than I, so I insisted she take it.

Then we turned back to the sarcophagus...

Order of Play

When the party of adventurers comes in contact with potential
enemies, time shifts to combat rounds (10 seconds long, as
described previously). Before beginning combat, surprise is
checked (see below). Then unsurprised characters roll for
Initiative, and act in order of the rolls (again, as described
below).

Surprise

When surprise is possible, roll 1d6 for each side which might be
surprised; most normal characters are surprised on a roll of
1-2. Surprised characters are unable to act for one round.
Characters or creatures which are well hidden and prepared to
perform an ambush surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. Some
characters or creatures (such as Elves) are described as being
less likely to be surprised; reduce the range by 1 for such
creatures.

For example: Darion the Human Fighter and Morningstar the Elven
Fighter/Magic-User open a door and come face-to-face with a
party of goblins. The GM rolls 1d6 for the goblins; on a 1-2
they are all surprised. Then the GM rolls 1d6 for Darion and
Morningstar. If the roll is a 1, both of them are surprised; if
the roll is a 2, only Darion is surprised. If the roll is 3 or
more, neither of them are surprised.

Surprised characters or creatures stand flat-footed for one
round. They still defend themselves, so there is no penalty to
Armor Class, but they cannot move nor attack during the round
of surprise.

Monster Reactions

When a group of player characters meet one or more monsters,
it's important to know how the monsters will react to the
party. In many cases, the reaction of the monster or monsters
is obvious... zombies guarding a tomb will virtually always
attack intruders, for example.

In cases where the reaction of the monsters to the party is not
obvious, a reaction roll may be made. The Game Master rolls
2d6, adding the Charisma bonus of the "lead" character (or
applying his or her Charisma penalty) along with any other
adjustments he or she feels are reasonable, and consults the
table below:

Reaction Roll Table

Adjusted Die Roll

Result

2 or less

Immediate Attack

3-7

Unfavorable

8-11

Favorable

12 or more

Very Favorable

A result of 2 or less means that the player characters have so
offended the monsters that they attack immediately. An
Unfavorable result means that the monsters do not like the
player characters, and will attack if they may reasonably do
so. A Favorable result simply means that the monsters will
consider letting the player characters live if they choose to
parley; it does not necessarily mean that the monsters like the
player characters. A Very Favorable result means that the
monsters (or perhaps only the monster leader) do, in fact, like
the player characters; this does not mean that the monsters will
just hand over their treasure, but it does indicate that they
may choose to cooperate with the player characters in mutually
beneficial ways.

As always, interpreting the results of this roll are left to the
GM, who may choose to alter the result if he or she believes a
certain result would be more enjoyable to play out than the one
rolled.

Initiative

Each round, 1d6 is rolled for Initiative for each character or
monster. This roll is adjusted by the character's Dexterity
bonus. High numbers act first. Any characters/monsters with
equal numbers act simultaneously. The GM may make single rolls
for groups of identical monsters at his option.

As the GM counts down the Initiative numbers, each character or
monster may act on his or her number. If desired, a combatant
can choose to wait until a later number to act. If a player
states that he or she is waiting for another character or
monster to act, then the player character's action takes place
on the same Initiative number as the creature he or she is
waiting for. In this case, the player character's action is
simultaneous with the creature waited for, just as if they had
rolled the same number. A character using a weapon with a long
reach (long spears, for instance) may choose to attack a
closing opponent on the closing opponent's number (i.e. when
the approaching enemy is in range) and thus attack
simultaneously with the opponent, even if the character rolled
lower for Initiative.

[-- Image: graphics13 --]Combat

Each character or creature involved in combat may move, if
desired, up to its encounter movement distance, and then
attack, if any opponent is in range, when its Initiative number
comes up. No movement is allowed after attacking.

Opponents more than 5' apart may move freely, but once two
opposing figures are within 5' of each other, they are
"engaged" and must abide by the rules under Defensive Movement,
below.

Running

Characters may choose to run; a running character is not
normally allowed to attack (but see Charging, below). Running
characters can move at double their normal encounter movement
rate. Characters are allowed to run a number of rounds equal to
2 times the character's Constitution, after which they are
exhausted and may only walk (at the normal encounter rate). For
monsters not having a given Constitution, allow the monster to
run for 24 rounds. Exhausted characters or creatures must rest
for at least a turn before running again.

Maneuverability

The following rules may be considered optional. They are hardly
needed for most dungeon adventures, but will add measurably to
combat situations in the wilderness, especially in waterborne
combat situations or when some or all combatants are flying.

Characters, creatures, and vehicles of various sorts have a
maneuverability class. This is given as a letter, from A to F,
referring to the table below. (Rows G and H are used only in
cases where the maneuverability of a creature or vehicle has
been reduced.)

All normal player characters, and in fact most moderately sized
creatures which walk on the ground, are maneuverability class
A. The class letter is given after the movement rate (or rates)
for a creature; if no maneuverability class is given, assume
that the creature is class A.

The maneuverability class determines how far a creature must
move between facing changes when moving about in combat. Class
A allows one facing change per 5' moved, class B allows one
facing change per 10' moved, and each successive class adds 10'
to that figure. In general, a facing change is any turn of up to
90º (a right-angle turn); on a square-gridded map, this means
turning to face directly to the right or left of the figure's
current facing. A half-turn (45º) still counts as a full facing
change. If using hexes, “diagonal” movement is generally not
available, so a facing change is the 60º turn to face toward
the hex-side to the right or left of the current facing.

There are a few exceptions to this rule:

First, any creature that does not move away from its starting
position during the combat round may make as many facing
changes as desired (though circumstances, such as trying to
turn a horse around in a narrow corridor, may prevent this).

Incorporeal flying creatures (such as spectres) are “better”
than class A, being able to turn freely at any point while
moving.

Creatures which are running (moving at double speed) may not
make facing changes of more than 60º, and suffer a reduction of
maneuverability by one row (from A to B, B to C, and so on).

Also, most creatures can shift one space laterally while
preserving their facing (this is called “sidestepping”), but
this may only be done when moving at normal (“walking”) speed,
not at fast (“running”) speed.

Class

Facing Changes Allowed

A

1 per 5'

B

1 per 10'

C

1 per 20'

D

1 per 30'

E

1 per 40'

F

1 per 50'

Climbing and Diving

For battles involving three dimensions, each creature or vehicle
has an altitude (when flying) or depth (underwater). For air or
sea battles, at least one of the creatures or vehicles should
start at an altitude/depth of 0, and a new 0 level can be
established at any time, to simplify play, by adjusting the
altitudes of each creature or vehicle.

A winged flier can gain up to 10' of altitude after moving
forward by the distance shown for its maneuverability class,
and can dive (lose altitude in a controlled fashion) at up to
twice the normal movement rate; if the creature does not move
horizontally by at least half its normal speed, it will stall,
being forced to dive at maximum rate for one round. Floating
creatures or vehicles (balloons, fly spell, flying carpets,
etc.) can climb vertically without horizontal motion up to half
the normal movement rate, but such “floaters” can only descend
at the normal movement rate, unless they have lost the ability
to float entirely.

Charging

Under some circumstances, characters or creatures may be allowed
to attack after a running move. This is called a charge, and
some specific limitations apply. First, the charging character
or creature must move at least 10 feet, and may move up to
double his or her normal movement rate, as given above. The
movement must be in a more or less straight line toward the
intended target, and the path to the target must be reasonably
clear. Finally, the attacker must be using a weapon such as a
spear, lance, or pole arm which is suitable for use while
charging. Certain monsters, especially including those with
horns, are able to use natural attacks when charging. If the
attacker does not have line of sight to the opponent at the
start of the charge, that opponent can’t be charged.

The attack made after the charge is made at +2 on the attack
roll. The charging character or creature takes a -2 penalty to
Armor Class for the remainder of the round. If the attack hits,
it does double damage.

Set Weapon Against Charge: Spears, pole arms, and certain other
piercing weapons deal double damage when “set” (braced against
the ground or floor) and used against a charging creature. For
this to be done, the character or creature being charged must
have equal or better Initiative; this counts as holding an
action: both attacker and defender act on the attacker's
Initiative number and are therefore simultaneous.

Evasion and Pursuit

Sometimes a party of adventurers will want nothing more than to
avoid a group of monsters (or sometimes, it's the monsters
avoiding the adventurers). If one group is surprised, and the
other is not, the unsurprised group may be able to escape
automatically (unless something prevents them from making an
exit).

Otherwise, the characters wanting to flee begin doing so on
their Initiative numbers. The GM may easily play out the
pursuit, following along on his or her map (note that the
players can't draw maps while they run headlong through the
dungeon or wilderness area). Any time a character must pass
through a doorway, make a hard turn, etc., the GM may require a
saving throw vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added); if the
save is failed, the character has fallen at that point and
moves no further that round; he or she may stand up and make a
full move on his or her Initiative number in the next round.

If at any point the pursuers are within 5' (melee range) at the
start of a round, they may begin melee combat; the fleeing
characters will be subject to “parting shots” as described
under Defensive Movement if they continue to flee after the
pursuers close to melee range.

If the fleeing characters or creatures are ever able to get
beyond the pursuer's sight for a full round, they have evaded
pursuit... the pursuers have lost them.

Defensive Movement

Any time a character turns his or her back on an adjacent
opponent (who has a ready weapon) and begins movement, that
opponent is allowed a “parting shot” with a +2 bonus to attack,
even if that opponent has already made all attacks for the
round. Opponents with attack routines must choose one attack
mode; for instance, a tiger with a claw/claw/bite routine could
only claw once or bite once.

Alternately, the character may begin backing away (at up to half
normal walking movement) while continuing to fight (if the
opponent remains within reach, i.e. follows the retreating
character). This is termed a fighting withdrawal.

How to Attack

To roll "to hit," the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds his or her
attack bonus (AB), as shown on the table on page 47, as well as
Strength bonus (if performing a melee attack) or Dexterity bonus
(if performing a missile attack) and any other adjustments
required by the situation. If the total is equal to or greater
than the opponent's Armor Class, the attack hits and damage is
rolled. A natural "1" on the die roll is always a failure. A
natural "20" is always a hit, if the opponent can be hit at all
(i.e. monsters that can only be hit by silver or magic weapons
cannot be hit by normal weapons, so a natural "20" with a
normal weapon will not hit such a monster).

Attacking From Behind

Attacks made from behind an opponent usually receive a +2 attack
bonus. This does not combine with the Sneak Attack ability (see
the Thief, above).

Normal Men

A note about normal men: The NM entry in the table above is for
normal men, also known as zero level characters. These
characters represent the artisans, shopkeepers, scullery maids,
and other non-adventurer characters who will appear in the game.
All such characters are NPCs, of course. Demi-human races have
few if any zero-level characters among their numbers; the vast
majority of “normal men” are humans.

Average zero-level humans have 1d4 hit points, and usually are
not proficient with any weapons except bare hands. Green troops
(those who have not been in battle yet) are zero-level, but they
have 1d6 hit points and are allowed to use any weapon allowed to
a Fighter.

It is recommended not to waste time in detailing the ability
score or other statistics of such characters further; they are
normal, as in “average,” and so very few would have extreme
statistics. A blacksmith might be credited with a Strength
score of 13 or more, or a savant with Intelligence of 16 or
more, but in general such things need not be detailed for most
of these characters.

Monster Attack Bonus

When looking up a monster's hit dice on the Attack Bonus Table,
ignore all "plus" or "minus" values; so a monster with 3+2 hit
dice, or one with 3-1, is still treated as just 3 hit dice. The
exception is monsters with 1-1 or lower hit dice, which are
considered less than one hit die and have an attack bonus of
+0.

Melee Combat

Melee occurs after a character has closed for combat and strikes
at a monster or other foe. Melee weapons or attacks may
generally only be used against foes who are engaged with the
attacker (as described above).

Missile Fire

Missile weapons may be used to attack foes at a distance. The
distance the attacker is from his target affects the attack
roll, as shown on the Missile Weapons Table in the Characters
section, above. In general, opponents within Short range are
attacked at +1 on the die, those beyond Short range but within
Medium range are attacked at +0, and those beyond Medium but
within Long range are attacked at -2. Foes beyond Long range
cannot be effectively attacked.

If a character attempts to use a missile weapon against a foe
who is within 5' of him or her (i.e. who is engaged with the
shooter), a penalty of -5 is applied to the attack roll. This
is due to the shooter dodging around to avoid the foe's
attacks. The only exception is if the attacker is behind the
target creature and undetected, or that creature is distracted
so as to not be able to attack the shooter; in these cases,
apply the usual +1 bonus (+3 total bonus if attacking from
behind).

Cover and Concealment

In certain situations, the intended target of a missile (or
melee) attack may have cover or concealment of some kind. Cover
is defined as "hard" protection such as that afforded by a thick
tree trunk or stone wall, that is, anything that will stop or
slow a missile weapon. Concealment is "soft" cover like fog or
light foliage that makes the target difficult to see but does
not affect the missile itself. Cover or concealment makes it
more difficult to strike an intended target, and thus a penalty
will be applied to the attacker's die roll depending upon how
much of the target is protected from attack. For concealment
the attack penalty should range from -1 (25% obscured) to -4
(90% obscured). For hard cover, these penalties should be
doubled.

Missile Weapon Rate of Fire

In general, missile weapons are allowed a single attack per
round, just as are melee weapons. However, crossbows are an
exception, as reloading a crossbow between shots is
time-consuming.

A light crossbow can be fired once per two rounds, and the user
may not perform any other actions (including movement) during
the “reloading” round. A heavy crossbow can be fired just once
per three rounds, again requiring the user to spend two rounds
doing nothing other than cocking and loading the weapon in
order to fire it again.

Of course, the user of such a weapon may drop or sling the
weapon and switch to another weapon rather than reloading.
Also, it is possible (especially when defending a position) to
load more than one crossbow in advance and then switch weapons
each round until all have been fired. In a dungeon environment
this sort of strategy is unlikely, of course.

Grenade-Like Missiles

When throwing grenade-like missiles (flasks of oil, etc.), a
successful attack roll indicates a direct hit. Otherwise, the
GM will roll 1d10 and consult the diagram below to determine
where the missile hit. Treat each number as representing a 10'
square area.

Missiles that Miss

With the exception of grenade-like missiles, missile weapon
which miss the intended target are normally considered lost.
However, if the weapon is fired into a melee where allies of
the shooter are involved, and the attack misses, it may hit one
of the allied creatures. The GM should decide which allies may
be hit, and roll attacks against each until a hit is made or
all possible targets are exhausted. These attack rolls are made
with the shooter's normal attack bonus, just as if he or she
intended to attack the allied creature. However, the GM must
make these rolls, not the player.

This rule is applied to attacks made by monsters, when
appropriate. However, the GM still makes the rolls.

This rule is intentionally vague; the GM must decide when and
how to apply it based on the circumstances of the battle. It is
recommended that no more than three allies be “tried” in this
way, but the GM may make an exception as he or she sees fit.

Damage

If an attack hits, the attacker rolls damage as given for the
weapon. Melee attacks apply the Strength bonus or penalty to
the damage dice, as do thrown missile weapons such as daggers
or spears. Usually, bows and crossbows do not gain the Strength
bonus, but sling bullets or stones do.

Also, magic weapons will add their bonuses to damage (and cursed
weapons will apply their penalty). Note that, regardless of any
penalties to damage, any successful hit will do at least one
point of damage.

As explained elsewhere, a creature or character reduced to 0 hit
points is dead.

Subduing Damage

Attacks made with the “flat of the blade” for non-lethal damage
are made at a -4 attack penalty and do half damage. Most
weapons can be used this way; only those with penetration or
slashing features on all sides cannot.

If a character is reduced to zero hit points who has taken at
least some subduing damage, the character becomes unconscious
rather than dying. (Any further subduing damage is then
considered killing damage, allowing the possibility that
someone might be beaten to death.) A character knocked out in
this way, but not subsequently killed, will wake up with 1 hit
point in 1d4 turns, or can be awakened (with 1 hit point) by
someone else after 2d10 rounds.

Brawling

Sometimes a character will attack without a weapon, striking
with a fist or foot. This is called brawling. Normal characters
do 1d3 points of subduing damage with a punch, 1d4 with a kick;
kicks are rolled at a -2 attack penalty. A character in no
armor or leather armor cannot successfully punch or kick a
character in metal armor, and in fact, if this is attempted the
damage is applied to the attacker instead of the defender. The
GM must decide which monsters can be successfully attacked this
way. All character classes may engage in brawling; there is no
“weapon” restriction in this case.

Wrestling

A wrestling attack requires a successful melee attack roll,
where success indicates the attacker has grabbed his or her
opponent. A successful wrestling attack causes the attacker to
move into the same “space” as the defender (if miniature
figures are used).

An attempt to hold a target having twice or more hit dice or
levels than the attacker will always fail.

Maintaining the hold is automatic unless the victim manages to
break free or the attacker releases the victim.

After achieving a hold on an opponent, the attacker can
automatically inflict unarmed damage (as if striking with a
fist), prevent a held opponent from speaking, use simple magic
items such as rings, or take any other action the GM chooses.
The attacker may also attempt to acquire an item the opponent
is holding (such as a weapon) or attempt to move the opponent
(as described below). A held character may be voluntarily
released whenever the attacker so desires.

The attacker can’t draw or use a weapon or use a wand, staff,
scroll or potion, escape another’s wrestling attack, cast a
spell, or pin another character while holding an opponent.

Moving the Opponent: The attacker can move up to one-half speed
(bringing the defender along) with a successful attack roll. A
+4 bonus applies to the attacker's roll if no one else is
involved in the struggle.

Acquiring an Object: The attacker may attempt to take an item
away from the defender. This requires an additional attack
roll; if the roll fails, the defender may immediately attempt
an attack roll (even if he or she has already attacked this
round) which, if successful, results in the defender pinning
the attacker; the defender may choose to escape in this case
instead of reversing the hold.

Actions Allowed to the Defender: The target of a successful hold
is immobile (but not helpless) at least until his or her next
action, as determined by Initiative. Such characters suffer a
penalty of -4 to AC against opponents other than the attacker.

On the defender's next action, he or she can try to escape the
pin with a saving throw vs. Death Ray; the defender must apply
the better of his or her Strength or Dexterity bonuses (or
penalties) on this roll. If the escape roll succeeds, the
defender finishes the action by moving into any space adjacent
to the attacker.

If more than one attacker has a hold on a particular defender, a
successful escape roll frees the defender from just one of those
attackers.

Held characters may also use simple magic items such as rings. A
character being held may not normally cast a spell, even if he
or she has not been silenced by the attacker.

Multiple Opponents: Several combatants can be involved in a
wrestling match. Up to four combatants can wrestle a single
opponent of normal size in a given round. Creatures that are
smaller than the attacker count for half, while creatures that
are larger count at least double (as determined by the GM).
Note that, after an opponent is pinned, other attackers benefit
from the -4 AC penalty applied to the defender.

On the other hand, it is possible for a character to attack the
attacker in an ongoing wrestling bout. In this case, a
successful hold on the attacker grants the original defender a
+4 bonus on subsequent escape rolls.

Wrestling With Monsters: In general, the rules above can be used
not only when character races wrestle but also when humanoid
monsters are involved. The GM will decide whether or not to
allow wrestling involving non-humanoid creatures on a
case-by-case basis; if this is allowed, the following
adjustments apply:

Creatures with extra grasping appendages (more than the usual
two) gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls or saving throws for each
such appendage. This includes creatures with feet capable of
grasping (such as monkeys or apes, giant spiders, etc.)

Large creatures able to fly may attempt to carry off their
opponents (even if the flying creature is the defender).

Wrestling attacks against creatures with touch attacks (such as
wights) causes the attacker to suffer one such attack
automatically every round.

Oil

A flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like missile. The oil
must be set afire in order to inflict damage; otherwise the oil
is just slippery. Assuming some means of igniting the oil is at
hand, a direct hit to a creature deals 1d8 points of fire
damage, plus in the next round the target takes an additional
1d8 points of damage, unless he or she spends the round
extinguishing the flames by some reasonable means. The GM must
judge the method used; rolling on the floor (assuming it's not
oily also) or covering the flames with a wet blanket are good
methods, for instance, while pouring or splashing water on
burning oil does little good.

If the oil is ignited by some sort of wick or fuse, then every
other creature within 5 feet of the point of impact receives
1d6 points of fire damage from the splash. A save vs. Death Ray
is allowed to avoid this damage. If the flask does not hit the
intended target (as described under Grenade-Like Missiles,
above), then that creature may also take damage from the
splash, and receives a saving throw. No saving throw is allowed
for a creature which has received a direct hit.

A flask of oil spilled or splattered on the ground will burn for
10 rounds. Those attempting to cross the burning oil will
receive 1d6 points of fire damage each round they are in it
(with no saving throw in this case).

Fire-resistant creatures (including those with fire-based
abilities) receive no damage from burning oil.

Holy Water

Holy water damages undead creatures. A flask of holy water can
be thrown as a grenade-like missile; the flask breaks if thrown
against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against
an incorporeal creature, it must be opened and poured out onto
the target, generally requiring the attacker to be adjacent to
the target.

A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 1d8 points of damage
to an undead creature. In addition, each such creature within 5
feet of the point of impact receives 1d6 points of damage from
the splash. Holy water is only effective for one round.

Morale

NPCs and monsters don't always fight to the death; in fact, most
will try to avoid death whenever possible. Each monster listing
includes the monster's Morale score, a figure between 2 and 12.
To make a Morale check, roll 2d6; if the roll is equal to or
less than the Morale score, the monster (or monsters) is
willing to stand and fight. If the roll is higher than the
score, the monster has lost its nerve. Monsters with a Morale
score of 12 never fail a Morale check; they always fight to the
death.

In general, Morale is checked when monster(s) first encounter
opposition, and again when the monster party is reduced to half
strength (by numbers if more than one monster, or by hit points
if the monster is alone). For this purpose, monsters
incapacitated by sleep, charm, or hold magic are counted as if
dead.

The Game Master may apply adjustments to a monster's Morale
score in some situations, at his or her discretion. Generally,
adjustments should not total more than +2 or -2. No adjustment
is ever applied to a Morale score of 12.

A monster that fails a Morale check will generally attempt to
flee; intelligent monsters or NPCs may attempt to surrender, if
the GM so desires.

Note that special rules apply to retainers; see the relevant
rules in the Adventure section, above.

Turning the Undead

Clerics can Turn the undead, that is, drive away undead monsters
by means of faith alone. The Cleric brandishes his or her holy
symbol and calls upon the power of his or her divine patron.
The player rolls 1d20 and tells the GM the result. Note that
the player should always roll, even if the GM knows the
character can't succeed (or can't fail), as telling the player
whether or not to roll may reveal too much.

The GM looks up the Cleric's level on the Clerics vs. Undead
table, and cross-references it with the undead type. If the
table indicates "No" for that combination, it is not possible
for the Cleric to affect that type of undead monster. If the
table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20
to Turn that sort of undead. If the table says "T" for that
combination, that type of undead is automatically affected (no
roll needed). If the result shown is a "D," then that sort of
undead will be Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than
merely Turned.

If the roll is a success, 2d6 hit dice of undead monsters are
affected; surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are being
Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies can be
Turned), but a minimum of one creature will always be affected
if the first roll succeeds.

If a mixed group of undead (say, a wight and a pair of zombies)
is to be Turned, the player still rolls just once. The result
is checked against the weakest sort first (the zombies), and if
they are successfully Turned, the same result is checked against
the next higher type of undead. Likewise, the 2d6 hit dice are
rolled only once. For example, if the group described above is
to be Turned by a 2nd level Cleric, he or she would first need
to have rolled a 15 or higher to Turn the zombies. If this is a
success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 7, this
would Turn both zombies and leave a remainder of 3 hit dice of
effect. Wights are, in fact, 3 hit die monsters, so assuming
the original 1d20 roll was a 20, the wight is Turned as well.
Obviously, were it a group of 3 zombies and a wight, the 2d6
roll would have to be a total of 9 or higher to affect them
all.

If a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all undead
monsters present are affected, he or she may try again in the
next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Turn
the undead fails, that Cleric may not attempt to Turn undead
again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a
mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose.

Undead monsters which are Turned flee from the Cleric and his or
her party at maximum movement. If the party pursue and corner
the Turned undead, they may resume attacking the party; but if
left alone, the monsters will not return or attempt to attack
the Cleric or those near him or her for at least 2d4 turns.

Undead monsters subject to a D (Damaged) result suffer 1d8
damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and apply the same
damage to all undead monsters affected); those reduced to zero
hit points are utterly destroyed, being blasted into little
more than dust. Those surviving this damage are still Turned as
above.

Energy Drain

Sometimes characters are exposed to energy drain from undead or
evil magic. Such energy drain is manifested in the form of
“negative levels.” For each negative level a victim receives,
he or she suffers a semi-permanent loss of one hit die worth of
hit points and a penalty of -1 on all attack and saving throw
rolls. The victim may or may not be allowed a saving throw to
resist the effect (depending on the specific monster type).

If the character's hit points are reduced to zero or less by
means of energy drain, the victim is immediately slain. If the
energy drain is caused by an undead monster, the victim will
usually be transformed into that sort of undead (exact details
vary by type of monster).

Negative levels may be removed by magic. When a negative level
is to be removed, divide the total number of hit points lost by
the number of negative levels (rounding normally) to determine
how many hit points are restored.

For example, a character suffers three negative levels of energy
drain. The hit point losses rolled were 6, 5, and 2, for a total
of 13 points lost. The first negative level removed restores 13
/ 3 = 4.3333 hit points (which is rounded to 4 even). Now the
character has two negative levels and has lost 9 hit points.
The next time a negative level is removed, the character
recovers 9 / 2 = 4.5 hit points, which is rounded to 5 even.
Now the character has one negative level and 4 hit points lost.
Removal of the last negative level will restore the remaining 4
points.

Those who have suffered energy drain generally have a gaunt,
haggard look about them, noticeable by observant characters.

Healing and Rest

Characters recover 1 current hit point of damage every day,
provided that normal sleep is possible. Characters who choose
full bedrest regain an additional hit point each evening.

Normal characters require 6 hours sleep out of every 24.
Subtract from this number of hours the character's Constitution
bonus; so a character with 18 Constitution needs only 3 hours
sleep per night (and a character with 3 Constitution needs 9
hours). Note that these figures are minimums; given a choice,
most characters would prefer to sleep two or more hours longer.

Characters who get less than the required amount of sleep suffer
a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws (as well as
not receiving any hit points of healing). For each additional
night where sufficient sleep is not received, the penalty
becomes one point worse. Regardless of how long the character
has gone without adequate sleep, the normal amount of sleep
will remove these penalties.

Constitution Point Losses

Any character who has lost Constitution points temporarily (such
as due to a disease) may regain them with normal rest. The rate
of recovery is one point per day, awarded each morning when the
character awakens from a normal night's sleep. If more than one
Constitution point was lost, the character must make a save vs.
Death Ray (without adjustments) to regain the final point;
failure results in a permanent loss of the point.

If a Constitution loss results in a lower bonus or penalty, the
character's maximum hit points must be reduced appropriately;
for instance, a character reduced from 16 to 15 Constitution
goes from +2 to +1, thus losing one hit point per die rolled.
If a reduction in maximum hit points reduces that figure to
less than the character's current hit points, reduce the
current hit points to the maximum hit point figure immediately.

When regaining Constitution, any increase that increases the
character's Constitution bonus results in the restoration of
the hit points lost due to the reduction, added to the maximum
hit point figure only. Current hit points will not be improved
in this fashion, but rather must be regained by normal healing.

Falling Damage

Characters suffer 1d6 damage per 10' fallen, up to a maximum
20d6. Fractional distances are rounded to the nearest whole
number, so that a fall of 1-4' does no damage, 5'-14' does 1d6,
etc.

Deafness and Blindness

A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel,
is surprised on 1-3 on 1d6, and suffers a -1 penalty to its
Initiative rolls. A blinded creature is surprised on 1-4 on
1d6, suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, a -4 penalty to
its Armor Class, and a -2 penalty to its Initiative rolls.

These penalties are for characters or creatures recently
handicapped. Those who are normally blind or deaf may have
reduced penalties at the GM's option.

Note that the penalty for attacking an invisible opponent is the
same as the penalty for attacking blind, that is, -4 on the
attack roll.

Attacking a Vehicle

Attacks against vehicles (such as wagons or ships) are made
against Armor Class 11. Each vehicle has listed Hardness and
Hit Point values. Roll damage against the vehicle, and then
reduce that damage by the Hardness value. Any excess damage is
applied to the vehicle.

If the vehicle takes damage equal to or greater than the listed
HP on one side, it is reduced to half speed due to wheel damage
or a hull breach; if it takes this much again, it is
immobilized, and this much damage will sink a ship.

Repairing a Vehicle

Damage done to a vehicle may be restored at a rate of 1d4 hit
points per crew member per hour of labor. However, a vehicle
can only be restored to 90% of its maximum hit points by field
repairs; a damaged ship must be put into drydock and repaired
by a shipwright and his crew, while a wagon, cart or chariot
will require a wagonmaker to repair them. Costs of such repairs
are left to the Game Master to decide.

Saving Throws

Saving throws represent the ability of a character or creature
to resist or avoid special attacks, such as spells or poisons.
Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll, with a
target number based on the character's class and level; for
monsters, a comparable class and level are provided for the
purpose of determining the monster's saving throw figures. A
natural (i.e. unadjusted) roll of 1 on a saving throw is always
a failure, while a natural 20 is always a success.

The are five categories of saving throw, ranked in order of
priority, are as follows: Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands,
Paralysis or Petrify, Dragon Breath, and Spells. Spells and
monster special attacks will indicate which category applies
(when a saving throw is allowed), but in some unusual
situations the Game Master will need to choose a category. One
way to make this choice is to interpret the categories
metaphorically. For example, a GM might be writing an adventure
wherein there is a trap that pours burning oil on the hapless
adventurers. Avoiding the oil might be considered similar to
avoiding Dragon Breath. Or perhaps a stone idol shoots beams of
energy from its glaring eyes when approached. This attack may be
considered similar to a Magic Wand, or if especially potent, a
Spell.

In general, saving throw rolls are not adjusted by ability score
bonus or penalty figures. There are a few exceptions:

* Poison saving throws are always adjusted by the Constitution
bonus of the character.

* Saving throws against illusions (such as phantasmal force) are
always adjusted by the character's Intelligence.

Other saving throw adjustments may be decreed by the GM at his
or her discretion.

Item Saving Throws

Area effects (such as fireball or lightning bolt spells) may
damage items carried by a character as well as injuring the
character. For simplicity, assume that items carried are
unaffected if the character or creature carrying them makes its
saving throw. However, very fragile items (paper vs. fire, glass
vs. physical impact, etc.) may still be considered subject to
damage even if the bearer makes his or her save.

In any case where one or more items may be subject to damage,
use the saving throw roll of the bearer to determine if the
item is damaged or not. The GM should feel free to amend this
rule as he or she sees fit; for instance, a backpack full of
fragile items might be given a single saving throw rather than
laboriously rolling for each and every item.

PART 6: MONSTERS

Name: The first thing given for each monster is its name (the
most common name, if the monster is known by more than one). If
an asterisk appears after the monster's name, it indicates that
the monster is only able to be hit by special weapons (such as
silver or magical weapons, or creatures affected only by fire,
etc.) which makes the monster harder to defeat.

Armor Class: This line gives the creature’s AC for normal
combat. If the monster customarily wears armor, the first
listed AC value is with that armor, and the second, in
parentheses, is unarmored. Some monsters are only able to be
hit (damaged) by silver or magical weapons; these are indicated
either in words or with a dagger †; some monsters may only be
hit with magical weapons, indicated by a double dagger ‡.

Hit Dice: This line gives the creature’s number and type of hit
dice, and lists any bonus hit points. Monsters always roll
eight sided dice (d8) for hit points, unless noted otherwise.

One or two asterisks (*) may appear after the hit dice figure;
where present, they indicate a Special Ability Bonus to
experience points (XP) awarded for the monster. See Character
Advancement in the Adventure section for more details.

If the monster's Attack Bonus is different than its number of
Hit Dice, for convenience the Attack Bonus will be listed in
parentheses after the Hit Dice figure.

Movement: This line gives the monster's movement rate, or rates
for those monsters able to move in more than one fashion. For
example, Goblins have a normal walking movement of 20', and
this is all that is listed for them. Mermaids can only move
about in the water, and so their movement is given as Swim 40'.
Pegasi can both walk and fly, so their movement is listed as 80'
Fly 160'.

In addition, a letter may appear in parentheses after a movement
figure; this letter is the Maneuverability Class. If a
Maneuverability Class is not listed, assume class A.

Attacks: The number (and sometimes type or types) of attacks the
monster can perform. For example, Goblins may attack once with a
weapon, so they are marked 1 weapon. Ghouls are marked 2 claws/1
bite as they can attack with both claws and also bite in one
round.

Damage: The damage figures caused by successful attacks by the
monster. Generally this will be defined in terms of one or more
die rolls.

No. Appearing: This is given in terms of one or more die rolls.
Monsters that only appear underground and have no lairs will
have a single die roll; those that have lairs and/or those that
can be found in the wilderness will be noted appropriately. For
example, a monster noted as “1d6 Wild 2d6 Lair 3d6” is
encountered in groups of 1d6 individuals in a dungeon setting,
2d6 individuals in the wilderness, or 3d6 individuals in a
lair.

Save As: The character class and level the monster uses for
saving throws. Most monsters save as Fighters of a level equal
to their hit dice.

Morale: The number that must be rolled equal to or less than on
2d6 for the monster to pass a Morale Check. Monsters having a
Morale of 12 never fail morale checks, and fight until
destroyed (or until they have no enemies left).

Treasure Type: This line reflects how much wealth the creature
owns. See the Treasure section for more details. In most cases,
a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no
treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that
own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to
carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.

XP: The number of experience points awarded for defeating this
monster. In some cases, the figure will vary; for instance,
Dragons of different age categories will have different XP
values. Review the Experience Points awards table in the
Adventure section, above, to calculate the correct figure in
these cases.

For convenience, animals commonly used to carry loads and/or
characters are listed here together. Such creatures obviously
have no treasure.

Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances
without food or water. The statistics presented here are for
the dromedary, or one-humped camel, which thrives in warm
deserts. A dromedary stands about 7 feet tall at the shoulder,
with its hump rising 1 foot higher. The two-humped, or
Bactrian, camel is suited to cooler, rocky areas. It is
stockier, slower (speed given in brackets), and tougher than
the dromedary. A light load for a camel is up to 400 pounds; a
heavy load, up to 800 pounds.

Donkeys are long-eared, horselike creatures. They are surefooted
and sturdy, and can be taken into dungeons or caverns. The
statistics presented here could also describe burros. A light
load for a donkey is up to 70 pounds; a heavy load, up to 140
pounds.

Draft Horses include large breeds of working horses such as
Clydesdales. These animals are usually ready for heavy work by
age three. A light load for a draft horse is up to 350 pounds;
a heavy load, up to 700 pounds.

Riding Horses include smaller breeds of working horses such as
quarter horses and Arabians as well as wild horses. These
animals are usually ready for useful work by age two. Riding
horses cannot fight while a rider is mounted. A light load for
a riding horse is up to 250 pounds; a heavy load, up to 500
pounds.

War Horses are trained and bred for strength and aggression.
They usually are not ready for warfare before age three. A
light load for a warhorse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up
to 700 pounds.

Mules are sterile crossbreeds of donkeys and horses. They can be
taken into dungeons or caverns. A mule is similar to a riding
horse, but slightly stronger and more agile. A light load for a
mule is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 600 pounds.

A Pony is a small horse, under 5 feet tall at the shoulder.
Ponies are otherwise similar to light horses and cannot fight
while carrying a rider. Ponies can be trained for war, and the
morale in parentheses above is for a war pony; this does not
allow them to fight while carrying a rider. A light load for a
pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.

A basilisk is an eight-legged reptilian monster that petrifies
living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a
dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens
sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk’s
body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which
can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature
weighs about 300 pounds.

Any living creature which meets the gaze of the basilisk must
save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone instantly. In
general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its
gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting
their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is
possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the
penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk
sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs.
Petrification or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses
its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or
other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes
closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster
with a mirror it may see its reflection.

Bats are nocturnal flying mammals. The statistics presented here
describe small, insectivorous bats. They have a natural sonar
that allows them to operate in total darkness; for game
purposes, treat this ability as Darkvision.

A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at least
in terms of doing damage) but can confuse those in the area,
flying around apparently randomly. For every ten bats in the
area, one creature can be confused; such a creature will suffer
a penalty of -2 on all attack and saving throw rolls while the
bats remain in the area.

A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200
pounds. They have the same sensory abilities as normal-sized
bats, but being much larger, they are able to attack
adventurers; many are carnivorous, making such attacks likely.

Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and
black abdomens. They are 3 to 4 feet long.

In combat, a giant bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of
it, and sprays a cone of very hot and noxious gases from a
nozzle in the rearmost tip of the abdomen. This toxic blast
causes 2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 10' long and
10' wide at the far end (a save vs. Death Ray for half damage
is allowed). A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray
attack up to five times per day, but no more often than once
per three rounds. Faced with opponents attacking from just one
direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away
and use the spray attack rather than biting.

Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have more or less
the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no
penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

Black puddings are are amorphous creatures that live only to
eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world,
scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic
matter, living or dead. They attack any creatures they
encounter, lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing
opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them
catch and digest their prey.

If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or
electricity, a black pudding suffers no injury, but will be
split into two puddings; the GM should divide the original
black pudding's hit dice between the two however he or she sees
fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may have less than
two hit dice. A two hit die black pudding is simply unharmed by
such attacks, but cannot be split further.

Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding either,
but such an attack will paralyze the pudding for one round per
die of damage the attack would normally cause. Other attack
forms will affect a black pudding normally; the preferred
method of killing one usually involves fire.

The typical black pudding measures 10 feet across and 2 feet
thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black puddings of
smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly s a result of the
splitting described above.

Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually
animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These
plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are
normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.

[-- Image: graphics21 --]The fragrance of the flowers is
detectable up to 30' from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood
roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations
sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal
conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save
vs. Poison or become befuddled, dropping anything carried and
approaching the plant. Each round such a creature or character
is within the affected area, this save must be made. Befuddled
characters will not resist the plant-creature's attacks; if
affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the
fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters,
constructs, etc. are not affected.

Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded
with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps
around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 damage
per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day)
“eaten” this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep
wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or
yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.

Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly
resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp
teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety
grows up to 30' long and frequently are found in caverns or
dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very
sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their
prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.

A caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human
(such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll
of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that
roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers
1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with
a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the
inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit,
fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to
the attack roll are applied.

Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally
attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and
digest its meal.

Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live
underground. They are eyeless, depending on their
sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a
variety of touch-sensitive “hairs” on their legs to sense the
environment around them.

These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as
well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they
will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around,
or spitting nasty goo.

All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed,
attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering
monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are
attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will
arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent)
will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit.
This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.

A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to
30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the
beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent
creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits,
the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from
the impact.

Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its
digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can
perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack
will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in
which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their
nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next
round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an
attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical
bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack
hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do
anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.

Displacers are blue-black, catlike monsters with strange bladed
arms extending from the shoulders. The blades are carried
folded back like wings, but the Displacer swings the blades
around in front to attack.

The real power and danger of the Displacer is its power of
displacement, which causes the monster's apparent location to
shift around constantly over a range of 3' from the monster's
true location. This is a form of illusion, but a powerful form
that cannot be seen through even by those who know the secret.

Any character fighting a Displacer for the first time will miss
his or her first strike regardless of the die roll. Thereafter,
all attacks against displacers will be at an attack penalty of
-2. This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind.
Some monsters, such as bats, do not depend on vision to fight
and thus may be able to perceive the monster's true location
and fight without penalty.

The djinn (singular djinni) are humanoid creatures from the
Elemental Plane of Air. A djinni in its natural form is about
10½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical
powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched
in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to
harass those who follow; the 12 morale reflects a djinni's
absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that
the creature will throw its life away easily. Use the “8”
figure to determine whether an outmatched djinn decides to
leave a combat.

Due to their highly magical nature, djinn cannot be harmed by
non-magical weapons.

Normal dogs include most medium and large breeds, including wild
dogs. After biting an opponent, a dog can hold on, doing 1d4
damage automatically every round, until killed or until the
victim spends an attack breaking free (which requires a save
vs. Death Ray, adjusted by the character's Strength bonus).

Riding dogs are a large breed, used primarily by Halflings for
transport. They may be trained for war, and equipped with
barding to improve their Armor Class. They can maintain a hold
in the same way that normal dogs do. A light load for a riding
dog is up to 150 pounds; a heavy load, up to 300 pounds.

Dopplegangers are strange beings that are able to take on the
shapes of those they encounter; they can also read minds (as
the spell, ESP, but with no limit of duration). In its natural
form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and
frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is
pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with
slitted pupils. A doppleganger’s appearance is deceiving even
when it’s in its true form. A doppleganger is hardy, with a
natural agility not in keeping with its frail appearance. In
its natural form a doppleganger is about 5-1/2 feet tall and
weighs about 150 pounds.

Dopplegangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to
stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society.
Although not usually evil, they are interested only in
themselves and regard all others as playthings to be
manipulated and deceived.

When in its natural form, a doppleganger strikes with its
powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed
person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such
cases, it uses its mind reading power to employ the same tactics
and strategies as the person it is impersonating.

Dragon

Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian
monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two
wings; this is how experts distinguish “true” dragons from other
large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they
grow slowly for so long as they live. For this reason, they are
described as having seven “age categories,” ranging from 3 less
to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table
is provided following the description of each dragon type; this
table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various
attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.

If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male
or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a
mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or
four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or
two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the
parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are
protecting their young.

A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long,
whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It
prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has
worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with
spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent
dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating
the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking
off weaker enemies).

Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as
it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category
do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more
often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws
and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be
used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws
may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature.
Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any
direction, even behind them.

The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 damage per hit die.
Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage. The
breath weapon may be projected in any direction around the
dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the dragon can
bite those behind it.

There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's
breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape,
which that type of dragon can use from the second age category
(-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2
hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one
of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category
(+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three
shapes.

The shapes are:

Cone Shaped: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and
is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum
length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum
width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and
age).

Line Shaped: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given
length in a straight line.

Cloud Shaped: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum
given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length
and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type
and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most,
20' deep or high.

All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able
to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;”
this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a
demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn
Elvish.

Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can
cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn
to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for
separately.

Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons are
covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins
and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible.
Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate area
or to get food. For dragons, there is no such thing as enough
treasure. It’s pleasing to look at, and they bask in its
radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their hoards, shaping
nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note that, for most
monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair of average
numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a single
individual of average age. Mated pairs do not share treasure!
Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts for the number of
monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a dragon of the
highest age category would have about double the given amount,
while one of the next to lowest age category would have perhaps
a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no treasure).

Tales are told of the adventurers who subdued various dragons.
Such stories are usually exaggerations. If players care to try,
the dragon may in fact seem to give up and become docile. As
soon as it recovers from the mistreatment, the dragon will try
to find a way to escape the players, retrieve its treasure, and
possibly seek revenge. Out of pride, a dragon will never seek
assistance from its own kind in this case, but might "use"
humanoids or other monsters to attack the party.

Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their
surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps
and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground;
trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability.
When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight,
so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.
Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still
motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect
valuable items.

Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part
of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey
comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this
case).

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying
in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match
the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their
advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot
in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into
the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until
opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack
(surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also
store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks
valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue
dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons.
They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering
their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and
killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon
will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with
that person as a cat plays with a mouse.

Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. They make heavy use
of spells in combat. Among their favorites are cloudkill, sleep,
and slow.

All gold dragons have the power to assume human form at will (in
a manner equivalent to the spell polymorph self, but performed
at will).

Unlike many other dragons, gold dragons are not cruel and do not
seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of gold dragons
offering assistance to adventurers. They are, however, every
bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold
need not bother asking for a loan.

Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation,
picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing
or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to
determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate
tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes
its presence known quickly – it enjoys evoking terror.

Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn
more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the
countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be
allowed to live so long as they remain interesting... but woe to
them when the dragon becomes bored.

Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to
appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap
decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked
out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak
creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them
with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they
might be carrying.

Red dragons are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt,
torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures. They are often
said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a red dragon will
attack almost any creature less powerful than itself.

Though they live in the water, and are somewhat adapted to it,
Sea Dragons still must breathe air, similar to dolphins or
whales. A Sea Dragon may hold its breath up to three turns
while swimming or performing other moderate activity.

Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, similar to white dragons.
They often maintain lairs in air-filled undersea caverns.

White Dragons prefer to live in cold regions, whether in the
highest mountains or in the cold northern lands. They are the
least intelligent of dragons, though this does not mean that
they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are
motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of
course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for
pleasure.

White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft
or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their
icy breath weapon, then try to knock out a single opponent with
a follow-up attack.

A dragon turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color
as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights
that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The
turtle’s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with
golden highlights. An adult dragon turtle can measure from 100
to 200 feet from snout to tail. They are occasionally mistaken
for rocky outcroppings or even small islands.

Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and generally attack any
creature that threatens their territory or looks like a
potential meal. Though they are not true dragons, they do
advance through the same sort of age categories as the true
dragons do; however, each age category changes the dragon
turtle's Hit Dice by 5.

Dryads are female nature spirits; each is mystically bound to a
single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300
yards from it. Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours.
A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic. A dryad lives as long as
her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad
is killed, her tree dies also.

A dryad’s delicate features are much like a female elf's, though
her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a
canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. Although
they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been
encountered in one place on rare occasions.

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they
are alluring -- they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen
unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a
dryad can charm (as the spell charm person), attempting to gain
control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the
rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into
a frenzied defense.

The efreet (singular efreeti) are humanoid creatures from the
Elemental Plane of Fire. An efreeti in its natural form stands
about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet are
malicious by nature. They love to mislead, befuddle, and
confuse their foes. They do so for enjoyment as well as a
battle tactic.

Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute control
over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will
throw its life away easily. Use the “9” figure to determine
whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.

Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by
non-magical weapons.

Elemental*

Elementals are incarnations of the elements that compose
existence.

It is possible to summon an elemental by one of three means: By
the use of a staff, or of a device, or by casting a spell. For
each elemental type, separate statistics are provided for each
of these three categories.

Due to their highly magical nature, elementals cannot be harmed
by non-magical weapons.

Air elementals resemble “dust devils,” but are more powerful.
Air elementals take double damage when attacked by earth-based
attacks (including by earth elementals). An air elemental may
choose either to attack a single opponent, thus receiving one
attack per round at the listed damage, or may choose to knock
all opponents in a 5' radius to the ground; if the latter
attack is used, all creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save
vs. Death Ray or fall prone. Creatures of 3 or more levels or
hit dice are not so affected. Air elementals do an additional
1d8 points of damage against creatures or vehicles which are
airborne.

Fire elementals are simply flames, which may appear generally
humanoid for brief moments when they attack. Fire elementals
take double damage when attacked by water (including water
elementals). They cannot cross a body of water wider than their
own diameter. They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against
creatures which are cold or icy in nature.

Remember that a fire elemental is burning; such a creature may
easily start fires if it moves into an area containing items
which burn easily, such as dry wood, paper, or oil. No specific
rules are given for such fires, but the GM is directed to the
rules for burning oil for an example of fire damage.

Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water. Huge
barracudas are about 12' long, while giant specimens can exceed
20'. They have elongated bodies, pointed heads and prominent
jaws. Their bodies are covered with smooth scales, typically
blue, gray or silver in color. They have extremely keen
eyesight and are surprised only on a 1 on 1d6. Due to the
quickness of their attack, barracudas are themselves capable of
surprising on 1-3 on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.

Giant barracudas always appear singly and are 50% likely to
break off the attack after 1d4 rounds if they haven't killed
their prey. Both kinds are very attracted to shiny objects.

Giant bass are generally between 10' and 25' long. Most are
greenish-grey, marked with dark lateral stripes, though some
are almost completely black. They are generally found in lakes
or rivers, as they are not adapted for salt water.

Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of 20 a
giant bass will swallow whole a dwarf-sized or smaller
creature, which then takes 2d4 damage per round until it is
dead. Swallowed characters can attack only with daggers or
similar short weapons. Note that each giant bass can swallow at
most one character, and a giant bass which has swallowed a
character will attempt to retreat (having achieved its goal).

Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that causes a
painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a save vs. Poison
is failed. The pain causes the affected character or creature
to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws;
further poisonings will increase this penalty by -1 each, down
to a maximum penalty of -5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the
duration of the poison effect.

Because of their size and body design, a giant catfish cannot
target more than one of its attacks on any single creature;
that is, it cannot bite and fin the same opponent, nor use both
fins on one victim.

the common frog; most resemble bullfrogs in appearance, but an

A giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15' and drag up to
dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every subsequent round, the
victim is hit automatically. On a natural 20 attack roll, the
victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6 damage per round
thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only one such victim.

Giant toads are statistically just like giant frogs; however,
they are often found in “drier” areas as they do not have to
maintain a wet skin surface.

Those hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack must save vs.
Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to
this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever
possible, striking from behind tombstones and bursting from
shallow graves; when these methods are employed, they are able
to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may
be Turned by Clerics and are immune to sleep, charm and hold
magics.

Humanoids bitten by ghouls may be infected with ghoul fever.
Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 5% chance of the
infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to
save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies
within a day.

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul
at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this
way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is
not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for
the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all
respects.

are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and
weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and
lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.

Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear
jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the
clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the
wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or
more instruments (the harp is a favorite).

Storm giants generally dress in short, loose tunic belted at the
waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear a few
pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, anklets (favored
by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. They
live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about
the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land

Storm giants prefer to attack first with their lightning bolts

40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually dull and glazed, varying
in color from red to yellow. A goblin’s skin color ranges from
yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all
members of a single tribe are about the same color. Goblins
wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab,
soiled-looking colors.

The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather
armor with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30'
and a natural Armor Class of 11.

Some goblins ride dire wolves into combat, and large groups of
goblins will often employ them to track and attack their foes.

Golem*

Golems are magically created automatons of great power.
Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and
elemental forces. The animating force for a golem is a spirit
from the Elemental Plane of Earth. The process of creating the
golem binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it
to the will of the golem’s creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their
creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable
of any strategy or tactics. A golem’s creator can command it if
the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator.
If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to
the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the
attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to
govern its actions in his or her absence. The golem’s creator
can order the golem to obey the commands of another person (who
might in turn place the golem under someone else’s control, and
so on), but the golem’s creator can always resume control over
his creation by commanding the golem to obey him alone.

Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects,
except when otherwise noted. They can only be hit by magical
weapons.

Amber golems are generally built to resemble lions or other
great cats. They are able to detect invisible creatures or
objects within 60', and can track with 95% accuracy through any
terrain type.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of
damage for every 3 full points of damage the attack would
otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem
to exceed its full normal hit points, the excess is ignored.
For example, an amber golem hit by a lightning bolt heals 6
points of damage if the attack would have dealt 20 points of
damage.

Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed
with two two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a
damage figure of 1d10/1d10 or by weapon.

When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance
each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem
goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage,
attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object
smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving
on to spread more destruction. The golem’s creator, if within 60
feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and
persuasively to the golem; he must make a save vs. Spells to
succeed at this, and at least 1 round of time is required for
each check. It takes 1 round of inactivity by the golem to
reset the golem’s berserk chance to 0%

These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike natural
bronze statues, they never turn green from verdigris. A bronze
golem is 10 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. A bronze
golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have
any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth
gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.

The interior of a bronze golem is molten metal. Creatures hit by
one in combat suffer an additional 1d10 damage from the heat
(unless resistant to heat or fire). If one is hit in combat,
molten metal spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage.
A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid the metal spray.

This golem has a humanoid body made from clay. A clay golem
wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment
around its hips. A clay golem cannot speak or make any vocal

A flesh golem is a ghoulish collection of stolen humanoid body
parts, stitched together into a single composite form. No
natural animal willingly tracks a flesh golem. The golem wears
whatever clothing its creator desires, usually just a ragged
pair of trousers. It has no possessions and no weapons. It
stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 500 pounds. A flesh golem
golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of
sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-jointed gait, as if not

When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1%

A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh
golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow
effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3

This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can
be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below),
although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its
features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron
golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem
is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem
cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any
distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth
gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.

Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a
10-foot cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of
effect must save vs. Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be
used up to 3 times per day.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron
golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A
magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on
the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 full points of
damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing
would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, the
excess is ignored. For example, an iron golem hit by a fireball
gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 19 points. An
iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that
of a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each hit
(with no saving throw normally allowed).

This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is
9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is
frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might
look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved
on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of
its limbs.

Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful
and difficult to harm. A stone golem can use a slow effect, as
the spell, once every other round; a save vs. Spells is allowed
to resist. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of
2d6 rounds.

A stone to flesh spell may be used to weaken the monster. The
spell does not actually change the golem’s structure, but for
one full round after being affected, the golem is vulnerable to
normal weapons. The stone golem is allowed a save vs. Spells to
resist.

Wood golems are small constructs, not more than 4' in height,
and are crudely made. Being made of wood makes them vulnerable

area 60' long by 10' wide, and can be used as many times per
day as the monster has hit dice, but no more often than every
other round. A save vs. Petrification is allowed to resist.

A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder,
measures 8 feet from snout to tail, and weighs about 4,000
pounds. Gorgons are nothing if not aggressive. They attack
intruders on sight, attempting to gore or petrify them. There

Gray oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They
inhabit underground areas, scouring caverns, ruins, and
dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. A gray
ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of
about 6 inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.

A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves
organic material and metal, but not stone. After a successful
hit, the ooze will stick to the creature attacked, dealing 2d8
damage per round automatically. Normal (non-magical) armor or
clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately. A
non-magical metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze
also dissolves immediately. Magical weapons, armor and clothing
are allowed a saving throw (use the wearer's save vs. Death Ray,
adding any magical “plus” value to the roll if applicable).

Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and
is even capable of dissolving metal given enough time. Bright
green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and
ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter.
It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and
possible food) below. Green slime cannot grow in sunlight; even
the indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and
prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill green
slime outright within a turn.

On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a
creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but
after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing the
same damage to both the victim and the slime). A cure disease
spell will destroy a patch of green slime. It does not harm
stone or enchanted metal, but can dissolve normal metal or
enchanted wood in a turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.

If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds, the victim
will be completely transformed into green slime; such a
character or creature cannot be retrieved by any magic short of
a wish.

Griffons are large carnivorous creatures resembling lions with
the head, foreclaws and wings of eagles. From nose to tail, an
adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor
females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings
emerge from the creature’s back and span 25 feet or more. An
adult griffon weighs about 500 pounds.

Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to feed on
horses, the beast’s preferred prey. They hunt and travel in
ocks. A Griffon will attack a horse over anything else,
diving low to swipe with their claws. They are not above
retreating and coming back later, when there may be less of a
defense mounted.

[-- Image: graphics46 --]Griffons can be trained as mounts if
raised in captivity, but even in this case they may try to
attack horses if any come within about 120'. Roll a morale
check in this case; if the check is failed, the griffon will
try to attack immediately. A light load for a griffon is up to
300 pounds; a medium load, up to 600 pounds; and a heavy load,
up to 900 pounds.

animated limbs that can wrap around the necks of living
creatures that pass beneath, strangling for 1d6 points of
damage per round. These limbs are arranged evenly around the
tree in most cases, and generally no more than one limb can

all creatures (other than Harpies) within a 300' radius must
succeed on a save vs. Spells or become charmed. The same
Harpy’s song cannot affect a creature that successfully saves
again for 24 hours. A charmed victim walks toward the Harpy,
taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into
a dangerous area (through ame, off a cliff, or the like), that
creature gets a second saving throw. Charmed creatures can take
no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within
reach of the Harpy stands there and offers no resistance to the
monster’s attacks. The effect continues for as long as the Harpy
sings, and for one round thereafter.

Hellhounds are canine creatures sheathed in hellish flame. A
typical hell hound stands 4½ feet high at the shoulder and
weighs 120 pounds. They are native to another plane, where they
roam freely, or are sometimes used as watchdogs. In the wild,
these creatures travel and hunt in packs. They have a breath
weapon, a flaming attack that may be used against a single
creature. 1/3 of the time (1-2 on 1d6), a hellhound will choose
to breathe fire; otherwise the hellhound will use its bite. Roll
each round to determine which is used. If the hellhound breathes
fire, its victim may save vs. Dragon Breath for half damage.
Each hellhound may breathe fire a number of times per day equal
to its hit dice.

Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice
each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the

A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other
creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes. Griffons sometimes
attack them, and the hippogriff will attack those creatures on
sight.

Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense,
save for those times a griffon is met. They are prized as
flying mounts since, unlike the griffon, they are relatively
safe around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise
one in captivity in order to use it as a mount. A light load

Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. They are
gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan
underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white.
Hydras are about 20 feet long and weigh about 4,000 pounds.

A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however,
most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a
character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a
particular head, and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that
head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be
able to attack anymore.

Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a
swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few
hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit
a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This
attack will be used 1/3 of the time (1-2 on 1d6) if it is
available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such
attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing
the amount by half.

An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large
group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit.
In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes,
though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in
order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If
the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10'
squares and the flying movement above is ignored.

Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm
suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are
doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not
wear armor, any creature having less than Armor Class 15 is
considered unarmored).

Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds
if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to
“ward off” the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other
similar-sized object around, and in this case also damage is
reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this
way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic
weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be
affected by a sleep spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm
away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s) due to smoke,
the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into
water will take damage for only one more round.

[-- Image: graphics51 --]Kobolds are small, dog-faced reptilian
humanoids. A kobold is 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs 35 to 45
pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can
see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can,
kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive
enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour
flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin
onto them. Kobolds suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in
bright sunlight or within the radius of light spells.

Giant leeches are slimy, segmented wormlike creatures which live
in water. Salt or fresh, clean or stagnant, there are giant
leech varieties for all wet environments. However, only a true
leech expert can tell the various types apart.

Once a giant leech hits in combat, it attaches to the victim and
sucks blood, causing an additional 1d6 damage each round until
the victim or the leech is dead. There is no way to remove the
leech other than to kill it.

Living Statue

Living statues are magically animated. They are true automatons,
unlike golems, which are animated by elemental spirits. While
this means that living statues have no chance of going
“berserk,” it also means that they may only perform simple
programmed activities. They may not be commanded in any
meaningful fashion. They make very effective guards for tombs,
treasure rooms, and similar places.

Living statues can be crafted to resemble any sort of living
creature, but most commonly are made to look like humans or
demi-humans.

Giant horned chameleon have very long tongues, able to spring
out up to 20' forward; the sticky muscular ball on the end
grabs on to the chameleon's prey, and the chameleon then drags
the prey to its mouth, doing bite damage automatically on the

A lizard man is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or
brown scales. Its tail is used for balance and is 3 to 4 feet
long. Adult males can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds. Due to
their great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage done
with melee weapons.

Lizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for
an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot
swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water
even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and
eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile). When they are able to
employ this maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

Lycanthrope*

Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves into
animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any
other human, though those who have been afflicted for a long
time tend to acquire features reminiscent of their animal
forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful
version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes
(which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of
unnatural intelligence.

Lycanthropy is spread like a disease. Any human who loses half
or more of his or her hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or
claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of
lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For demi-humans and humanoids,
contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A
cure disease cast before the onset is complete will stop the
progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the
transformation is permanent.

In animal form, lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or
magical weapons.

In addition to assuming the form of a giant rat, wererats can
assume an intermediate form (a “rat-man”). The ratman form
shares the animal form's immunity to normal weapons, and can
deliver an identical bite, but in this form the wererat may use

A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from
her head instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any
creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrification is made.
In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its
gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting
their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC.
It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other
reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa
suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a
medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrification
itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others,
but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to
petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid
mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their
eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the
monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.

Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save
vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not
individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).

A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding
its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet
tall and about the same weight as a human.

Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of
dolphins. Also called "sirens," mermaids usually attempt to
lure sailors or other men found near the sea to have relations
with them. They accomplish this by means of their enchanting
songs.

Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds
ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can
produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means
that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and
whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one
or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.

A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but
generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect
must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward
the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two
mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more
than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to
anything the mermaid desires. Depending on the mermaid's
temperament, after the man is used for reproductive purposes he
might be freed or slain.

Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half
fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for
up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of
strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two
turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per
turn.

Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter
which are male, 19 out of 20 have legs rather than tails. Such
will either be slain by their mothers, or put ashore to be
adopted by humans. Mermen with tails are raised to be
subservient to the females. A small community of mermaids (3d6
including the male) will often form around such a merman and
his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a group is called a
pod.

One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can
sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids
usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close
friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number
appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.

A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as
they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the
attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any
pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number
rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only
in groups of 1 or 2.

Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish
and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids are sometimes more than 1
hit die, and about 3% have Clerical abilities.

wear bright clothing, often including a cap and shoes with
curled and pointed toes. A pixie stands about 2-1/2 feet tall
and weighs about 30 pounds.

A pixie can become invisible at will, as many times per day as
it wishes, and can attack while remaining invisible. Anyone
attacking an invisible pixie does so with an attack penalty of
-4 unless the attacker can somehow detect invisible creatures.
Pixies may ambush their foes while invisible; if they do so,
they surprise on 1-5 on 1d6.

Pixies can only fly for 3 turns maximum before requiring rest of
at least one turn (during which time the pixie may walk at
normal speed but may not fly).

Pterodactyls are prehistoric winged reptilian creatures, having
a wingspan of around 25 to 30 inches. Though they eat mostly
fish, they may attack smaller characters or scavenge unguarded
packs.

Pteranodons are essentially giant-sized pterodactyls, having
wingspans of 25 feet or more. They are predators, and may
attack adventuring parties.

Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely
found above ground. The body of a mature purple worm is 5-8 feet
in diameter and 60-100 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds.

The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail; those injured
by it must save vs. Poison or die. Any time a purple worm
successfully bites a man-sized or smaller opponent with a
natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been swallowed, and
will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due to being
digested. A character who has been swallowed can only
effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such
as dagger or shortsword.

These omnivorous rodents thrive almost anywhere. Normal rats
attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm
reduces their numbers by one animal.

Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests
and territories. A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long
and weigh over 50 pounds. A single giant rat, or a small group
of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack
fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.

Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease. A character
who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates
disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will
lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each
point, the character is allowed a save vs. Death Ray (adjusted
by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the
fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero
Constitution is dead. See Constitution Point Losses in the
Encounter section for details on regaining lost Constitution.

* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or
killing an entire pack of normal size. If the adventurers are
forced to flee, the GM should award 3 XP per rat slain.

The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and scorpions, though
it is not properly either. Rhagodessas have “pedipalps,” an
elongated extra pair of legs in front that have sticky pads on
them for capturing prey.

Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert
terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while
those found underground may be black or white in color (those
found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders,
they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or
otherwise climb entirely upside down.

A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast, and
will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth the next round and
automatically hit for 2d8 damage. The rhagodessa will not use
its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way,
and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If
threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will
attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.

The rhinoceros is infamous for its bad temper and willingness to
charge intruders.

The statistics presented here are based on the African black
rhino, which is 6 to 14 feet long, 3 to 6 feet high at the
shoulder, and weighs up to 6,000 pounds. These statistics can
describe any herbivore of similar size and similar natural
weapons (antlers, horns, tusks, or the like).

The woolly rhinoceros is a prehistoric beast with long fur,
found in primitive “lost world” areas in colder territories.
They behave much as the black rhino does.

Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a “small” roc is
huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan of 24 feet.
Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around
48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive
wingspans of around 80 feet.

A light load for a small roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load
is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope
to ride upon a small roc. For a large roc, a light load is up
to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1200. Giant rocs can
easily lift up to 3000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when
carrying up to 6000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off
full grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a
young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous
birds.

A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to
tail. Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage,
with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden
(if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in
its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to
devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks
against a single creature results in that creature being
carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the
roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be
further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given
to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is
solitary). A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack
any man-sized or larger creature that appears edible. A mated
pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend
their nests or hatchlings.

The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan
underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster’s prehensile
antennae can rust metals on contact. The typical rust monster
measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing 200 pounds.

A rust monster's touch transforms metal objects into rust (or
verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal
attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such
as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A
non-magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half
damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one
“plus” each time they make contact with the rust monster;
this loss is permanent.

The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a
substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to
cease pursuit of metal-armored characters. Use a morale check to
determine this.

Salamanders are large, lizard-like creatures from the elemental
planes. They are sometimes found on the material plane; they
can arrive through naturally-occurring dimensional rifts, or
they may be summoned by high-level Magic-Users. Due to their
highly magical nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical
weapons.

Flame salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Fire. They
look like giant snakes, more than 12' long, with dragonlike
heads and lizard forelimbs. Their scales are all the colors of
flame, red and orange and yellow. A flame salamander is flaming
hot, and all non-fire-resistant creatures within 20' of the
monster suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the heat.
They are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack. Flame
salamanders are intelligent; they speak the language of the
Plane of Fire, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or
Dragon.

Frost salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Water. They
look like giant lizards with six legs. Their scales are the
colors of ice, white, pale grey and pale blue. Frost
salamanders are very cold, and all non-cold-resistant creatures
within 20' suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the cold.
Frost salamanders are completely immune to all types of
cold-based attacks. They are quite intelligent; all speak the
language of the Plane of Water, and many also speak Common,
Elvish, and/or Dragon.

Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each type will
attack the other on sight, in preference over any other foe.

A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but
stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places. They lurk in
dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by. A shadow is 5
to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak
intelligibly. Despite their strange nature and appearance,
shadows are not undead monsters, and thus cannot be Turned by a
Cleric.

A shadow's attack does 1d4 damage (from cold) and drains 1 point
of Strength from the victim. Victims reduced to 2 or fewer
points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those
reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at
nightfall). Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are
recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.

Due to their incorporeal nature, they cannot be harmed by
non-magical weapons.

Giant shrews resemble giant rats, but are larger, being up to 6'
long, and darker in color. They have a very fast metabolic rate
and must eat almost constantly. Giant shrews are omnivorous,
and aggressively defend their nests and the immediate territory
around them.

Giant shrews move so swiftly that they are able to bite twice
per round, and they may attack two different adjacent opponents
in this way.

A few giant shrew species (generally no more than 5% of those
encountered) are venomous. The bite of such a giant shrew will
kill the victim unless a save vs. Poison is made. A victim
bitten twice in a round need only save once for that round, but
of course will have to save again in subsequent rounds if bitten
again. Venomous giant shrews are considered 1* with respect to

A shrieker is a large, semi-mobile fungus that emits a loud
noise to attract prey or when disturbed. They live in dark,
subterranean places. Shriekers come in several shades of
purple.

A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures monsters to
its vicinity by emitting a loud noise. Movement or a light
source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a
piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts
nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some
creatures that live near shriekers come to learn that the
fungus’s noise means there is food nearby. In game terms, the
GM should roll a wandering monsters check each round that a

Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes. There are many varieties
ranging in size from 2' to 12' at adulthood; the statistics
above are for an “average” variety which reaches about 9' in
length.

Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive “pits” between
their eyes and nostrils. These are used to detect birds,
mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes. Note
that, even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can
still sense them because their temperature will often be
slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.

Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the

very stealthy in the water. Their bite does so little damage
that the creature bitten has only a 50% chance to notice the
attack, but their poison is terribly strong, such that any

Giant tarantulas are huge, hairy spiders, about the size of a
pony. They run down their prey much as wolves do. The bite of
the giant tarantula is poisonous; those bitten must save vs.
Poison or be forced to dance wildly. The dance lasts 2d10
rounds, during which time the victim has a -4 penalty on attack
and saving throw rolls. If the victim is a Thief, he or she
cannot use any Thief abilities while dancing. Onlookers must
save vs. Spells or begin dancing themselves; such “secondary”
victims suffer the same penalties as above, but they will only
dance for 2d4 rounds.

Each round the original victim dances, he or she must save vs.
Poison again or take 1d4 points of damage. Secondary victims do
not suffer this effect.

Neutralize poison will cure the original victim, and dispel
magic will stop the dance for all victims in the area of
effect, whether they are original or secondary.

their way to fight evil and ugliness and to protect their
homelands. Sprites fight their opponents with spell-like

Like rhinos, they are herd animals, and males aggressively
defend the herd; females only enter combat if the male(s) are

A treant is a large, roughly humanoid tree-man. Treants have
leaves of deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and
winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they
rarely fall out. A treant’s legs fit together when closed to
look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is
nearly indistinguishable from a tree. A treant is about 30 feet
tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about
4,500 pounds.

Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Elvish. Most
also can manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid
tongues, at least enough to say “Get away from my trees!”

Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before
attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the
despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as
reinforcements.

[-- Image: graphics66 --]A treant can animate trees within 180'
at will, controlling up to two trees at a time. It takes one
round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves
at a speed of 10' and fights as a treant in all respects. Such
trees lose their ability to move if the treant that animated
them is incapacitated or moves out of range.

They can change color at will, and 50% of the time a group can
blend into the environment well enough to surprise on a roll of
1-5 on 1d6. Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any

They are very hostile, attacking equal or weaker non-troglodyte
groups on sight. They prefer to attack with surprise, depending

Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of
damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit
points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which
point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may “play
dead” until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and
acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a
troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower
morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces
attackers armed with fire or acid. If a troll loses a limb or
body part, the lost portion regrows in one turn; or, the
creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding
it to the stump.

A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
A troll’s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray,
or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron
gray. They appear sexless if examined, and their method of
reproduction is a mystery. Trolls walk upright but hunched
forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when
they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all
this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.

[-- Image: graphics59 --]Unicorns are horselike creatures having
a single spirally-twisted horn in the middle of the forehead. A
typical adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet
high at the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are
slightly smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep
sea-blue, violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a
white beard.

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their
forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like
lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic
weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.

Three times per day a unicorn can cast cure light wounds by a
touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself
360' (as the spell dimension door), and can carry a full load
(possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a
unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.

An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they
always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close
enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as
evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and
clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures
for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid
stronger parties.

Alicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as
unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will,
exactly as if wearing a ring of invisibility.

These creatures appear to be normal Hobgoblins, but Urgoblins
are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to
regenerate much as do Trolls (and have the same limitations).
All Urgoblins are male; if an Urgoblin mates with a female
Hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in
four such offspring will share their father's gifts.

Some Hobgoblin tribes consider Urgoblins an abomination, and
kill them whenever they can be identified. Other Hobgoblin
tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord
them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely
made up of Urgoblins, with kidnapped Hobgoblin females as their
mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to
their mates, so that only those who have the power of
regeneration survive.

Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their
features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look
of wolves. They often embrace finery and decadence and may
assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance,
vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and
throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they
knew in life.

A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. Spells
is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of
the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not
resist being bitten by the vampire.

The bite inflicts 1d3 damage, then each round thereafter one
energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire
regenerates a 1d6 hit points (if needed) for each energy level
drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, he or she
will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than
12 hours later). Vampires spawned in this way are under the
permanent control of the vampire who created them.

If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to
Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For
this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have
great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using
melee weapons, and a vampire will generally choose to use a
melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than
attempting to bite.

Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all
undead are immune to sleep, charm and hold spells. If reduced
to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though
it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8
hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming
normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.

Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per
day can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6
giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such
creatures are nearby). These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and
serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.

A vampire can assume the form of a giant bat or a dire wolf at
will, requiring one round to complete the transformation. The
flying movement listed is for the giant bat form. In animal
form, the vampire can use the normal attacks for that form. It
can't use its other powers while in animal form, except that
creatures summoned are still controlled, and charms already in
effect continue in effect.

For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses:

Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of
garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they
recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These
things don’t harm the vampire -- they merely keep it at bay. A
recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a
creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or
make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for
the rest of the encounter.

Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they
can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard
a ship.

They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless
invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may
freely enter public places, since these are by definition open
to all.

Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower
incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it, as described
above. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any
vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can act for only
one round and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it
cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water
robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is
destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a
wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the
monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed,
unless the body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described
above, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre.

Giant water termites vary from 1' to 5' in length. They attack
using a noxious spray with a range of 5' which stuns the target
for a full turn on a hit; a save vs. Poison is allowed to avoid
the effect.

However, the primary concern regarding these monsters is the
damage they can do to boats and ships. Each creature can do 2d4
points of damage to a ship's hull per round (no roll required)
for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature's hit
dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat
noisily.

These creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in
swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit
dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in
swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.

Giant weasels resemble their more normally sized cousins, having
long bodies, short legs, and pointed, toothy snouts. They are
predatory animals, hunting those creatures smaller than
themselves.

Weasels of all sorts are cunning, crafty hunters, and surprise
their prey on 1-3 on 1d6. Once a giant weasel bites a living
creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until
the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a
morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of
its victim and flee.

There are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including
several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the
giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only
distinction is that those which are tamed are always called
ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various
humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to
tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.

flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail. A wyvern’s
body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length
is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about
one ton.

Wyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators
with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a
loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of
a bull alligator.

Wyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more
powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing

living creature hit by the wyvern's stinger must save vs.
Poison or die. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when
making a flyby attack or when landing.

If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry
off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be
carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most
6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make
any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim
makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it
may be dropped. This may mean a fall from a great height.

If disturbed, a patch of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of
poisonous spores. Each patch covers from 10 to 25 square feet;
several patches may grow adjacent to each other, and will
appear to be a single patch in this case. Each patch can emit a
cloud of spores once per day. All within 10 feet of the mold
will be affected by the spores and must save vs. Death Ray or
take 1d8 points of damage per round for 6 rounds. Sunlight

Zombies are the undead corpses of humanoid creatures. They are
deathly slow, but they move silently, are very strong and must
be literally hacked to pieces to "kill" them. The new They take
only ½ damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from
arrows, bolts or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). A
zombie never has Initiative and always acts last in any given
round. Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are
immune to sleep, charm and hold magics. As they are mindless,
no form of mind reading is of any use against them. Zombies
never fail morale checks, and thus always fight until
destroyed.
