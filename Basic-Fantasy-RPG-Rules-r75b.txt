PART 6: MONSTERS

Name: The first thing given for each monster is its name (the
most common name, if the monster is known by more than one). If
an asterisk appears after the monster's name, it indicates that
the monster is only able to be hit by special weapons (such as
silver or magical weapons, or creatures affected only by fire,
etc.) which makes the monster harder to defeat.

Armor Class: This line gives the creature’s AC for normal
combat. If the monster customarily wears armor, the first
listed AC value is with that armor, and the second, in
parentheses, is unarmored. Some monsters are only able to be
hit (damaged) by silver or magical weapons; these are indicated
either in words or with a dagger †; some monsters may only be
hit with magical weapons, indicated by a double dagger ‡.

Hit Dice: This line gives the creature’s number of hit dice, and
lists any bonus hit points. Monsters always roll eight sided
dice (d8) for hit points, unless otherwise noted. So a creature
with 3+2 hit dice rolls 3d8 and adds 2 points to the total.

One or two asterisks (*) may appear after the hit dice figure;
where present, they indicate a Special Ability Bonus to
experience points (XP) awarded for the monster. See Character
Advancement in the Adventure section for more details.

If the monster's Attack Bonus is different than its number of
Hit Dice, for convenience the Attack Bonus will be listed in
parentheses after the Hit Dice figure.

Movement: This line gives the monster's movement rate, or rates
for those monsters able to move in more than one fashion. For
example, Goblins have a normal walking movement of 20', and
this is all that is listed for them. Mermaids can only move
about in the water, and so their movement is given as Swim 40'.
Pegasi can both walk and fly, so their movement is listed as 80'
Fly 160'.

In addition, a distance may appear in parentheses after a
movement figure; this is the creature's turning distance (see
Part 5: The Encounter). If a turning distance is not listed,
assume 5'.

Attacks: The number (and sometimes type or types) of attacks the
monster can perform. For example, Goblins may attack once with a
weapon, so they are marked 1 weapon. Ghouls are marked 2 claws/1
bite as they can attack with both claws and also bite in one
round.

Damage: The damage figures caused by successful attacks by the
monster. Generally this will be defined in terms of one or more
die rolls.

No. Appearing: This is given in terms of one or more die rolls.
Monsters that only appear underground and have no lairs will
have a single die roll; those that have lairs and/or those that
can be found in the wilderness will be noted appropriately. For
example, a monster noted as “1d6, Wild 2d6, Lair 3d6” is
encountered in groups of 1d6 individuals in a dungeon setting,
2d6 individuals in the wilderness, or 3d6 individuals in a
lair.

Note that number appearing applies to combatants. Non-combatant
monsters (juveniles, and sometimes females) do not count in
this number. The text of the monster description should explain
this in detail where it matters, but the GM is always the final
arbiter.

Save As: The character class and level the monster uses for
saving throws. Most monsters save as Fighters of a level equal
to their hit dice.

Morale: The number that must be rolled equal to or less than on
2d6 for the monster to pass a Morale Check. Monsters having a
Morale of 12 never fail morale checks, and fight until
destroyed (or until they have no enemies left).

Treasure Type: This line reflects how much wealth the creature
owns. See the Treasure section for more details. In most cases,
a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no
treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that
own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to
carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.

XP: The number of experience points awarded for defeating this
monster. In some cases, the figure will vary; for instance,
Dragons of different age categories will have different XP
values. Review the Experience Points awards table in the
Adventure section, above, to calculate the correct figure in
these cases.

For convenience, animals commonly used to carry loads and/or
characters are listed here together. Such creatures obviously
have no treasure.

Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances
without food or water. The statistics presented here are for
the dromedary, or one-humped camel, which thrives in warm
deserts. A dromedary stands about 7 feet tall at the shoulder,
with its hump rising 1 foot higher. The two-humped, or
Bactrian, camel is suited to cooler, rocky areas. It is
stockier, slower (speed given in brackets), and tougher than
the dromedary. A light load for a camel is up to 400 pounds; a
heavy load, up to 800 pounds.

Donkeys are long-eared, horselike creatures. They are surefooted
and sturdy, and can be taken into dungeons or caverns. The
statistics presented here could also describe burros. A light
load for a donkey is up to 70 pounds; a heavy load, up to 140
pounds.

Draft Horses include large breeds of working horses such as
Clydesdales. These animals are usually ready for heavy work by
age three. A light load for a draft horse is up to 350 pounds;
a heavy load, up to 700 pounds.

Riding Horses include smaller breeds of working horses such as
quarter horses and Arabians as well as wild horses. These
animals are usually ready for useful work by age two. Riding
horses cannot fight while a rider is mounted. A light load for
a riding horse is up to 250 pounds; a heavy load, up to 500
pounds.

War Horses are trained and bred for strength and aggression.
They usually are not ready for warfare before age three. A
light load for a warhorse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up
to 700 pounds.

Mules are sterile crossbreeds of donkeys and horses. They can be
taken into dungeons or caverns. A mule is similar to a riding
horse, but slightly stronger and more agile. A light load for a
mule is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 600 pounds.

A Pony is a small horse, under 5 feet tall at the shoulder.
Ponies are otherwise similar to riding horses and cannot fight
while carrying a rider. Ponies can be trained for war, and the
morale in parentheses above is for a war pony; this does not
allow them to fight while carrying a rider. A light load for a
pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.

Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical

encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death.
They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes
have a small amount of treasure in their lair.

[-- Image: graphics15 --]Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny
metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant
ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively

A basilisk is an eight-legged reptilian monster that petrifies
living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a
dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens
sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk’s
body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which
can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature
weighs about 300 pounds.

Any living creature which meets the gaze of the basilisk must
save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone instantly. In
general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its
gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting
their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is
possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the
penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk
sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs.
Petrification or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses
its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or
other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes
closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster
with a mirror it may see its reflection.

Bats are nocturnal flying mammals. The statistics presented here
describe small, insectivorous bats. They have a natural sonar
that allows them to operate in total darkness; for game
purposes, treat this ability as Darkvision.

A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at least
in terms of doing damage) but can confuse those in the area,
flying around apparently randomly. For every ten bats in the
area, one creature can be confused; such a creature will suffer
a penalty of -2 on all attack and saving throw rolls while the
bats remain in the area.

A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs about 200
pounds. They have the same sensory abilities as normal-sized
bats, but being much larger, they are able to attack
adventurers; many are carnivorous, making such attacks likely.

[-- Image: graphics17 --]Bear

Bears attack by rending opponents with their claws, dragging
them in and biting them. A successful hit with both paws
indicates a hug attack for additional damage (as given for each
specific bear type). All bears are very tough to kill, and are
able to move and attack for one round after losing all hit
points.

Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and
black abdomens. They are 3 to 4 feet long.

In combat, a giant bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of
it, and sprays a cone of very hot and noxious gases from a
nozzle in the rearmost tip of the abdomen. This toxic blast
causes 2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 10' long and
10' wide at the far end (a save vs. Death Ray for half damage
is allowed). A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray
attack up to five times per day, but no more often than once
per three rounds. Faced with opponents attacking from just one
direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away
and use the spray attack rather than biting.

Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have more or less
the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no
penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

These luminous nocturnal insects are prized by miners and
adventurers. They have two glands, one above each eye, that
produce a red glow. The glands’ luminosity persists for 1d6
days after removal from the beetle, illuminating a roughly
circular area with a 10-foot radius.

Giant fire beetles are about 2 feet long. They are normally
timid but will fight if cornered. Like most beetles, they have
more or less the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus
suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

They are fast runners, depending on their speed to run down
prey, and they willingly prey on any creature of man size or
smaller. Like most beetles, they have more or less the same

Black puddings are are amorphous creatures that live only to
eat. They inhabit underground areas throughout the world,
scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic
matter, living or dead. They attack any creatures they
encounter, lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing
opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them
catch and digest their prey.

If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or
electricity, a black pudding suffers no injury, but will be
split into two puddings; the GM should divide the original
black pudding's hit dice between the two however he or she sees
fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may have less than
two hit dice. A two hit die black pudding is simply unharmed by
such attacks, but cannot be split further.

Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding, but such
an attack will paralyze the pudding for one round per die of
damage the attack would normally cause. Other attack forms will
affect a black pudding normally; the preferred method of killing
one usually involves fire.

The typical black pudding measures 10 feet across and 2 feet
thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black puddings of
smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as a result of the
splitting described above.

The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited
teleportation ability; they are able to teleport up to 120' at
will. Blink dogs may teleport immediately after attacking, thus
possibly avoiding being attacked. They hunt in packs,
teleporting in a seemingly random fashion until they surround
their prey, allowing some of them to get the bonus for
attacking from behind.

Blink dogs have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps,
whines, and growls that can transmit complex information. They
are usually shy, avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate
displacers and will generally attack them on sight.

Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually
animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These
plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are
normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.

[-- Image: graphics21 --]The fragrance of the flowers is
detectable up to 30' from the plant in ideal conditions. Blood
roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations
sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal
conditions. Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save
vs. Poison or become befuddled, dropping anything carried and
approaching the plant. Each round such a creature or character
is within the affected area, this save must be made. Befuddled
characters will not resist the plant-creature's attacks; if
affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the
fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later. Undead monsters,
constructs, etc. are not affected.

Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded
with thorns with which it can attack. When a cane hits, it wraps
around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 damage
per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day)
“eaten” this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep
wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or
yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.

Bugbears look like huge, hairy goblins, standing about 6 feet
tall. Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color and they
move very quietly. They are wild and relatively fearless, and
bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.

Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents if they can. When hunting,
they often send scouts ahead of the main group. Bugbear attacks
are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant.
They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising
opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage
due to their great Strength.

[-- Image: graphics4 --]One out of every eight bugbears will be
a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to
damage. In lairs of 16 or more bugbears, there will be a
chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage.
Bugbears gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a
hardened warrior or chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail
a morale check as long as the chieftain is alive. In addition,
there is a 2 in 6 chance that a shaman will be present in a
lair. A shaman is equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically,
but possesses 1d4+1 levels of Clerical abilities.

Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly
resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp
teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety
grows up to 30' long and frequently are found in caverns or
dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very
sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their
prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.

A caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human
(such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll
of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that
roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers
1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with
a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the
inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit,
fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to
the attack roll are applied.

Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally
attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and
digest its meal.

These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as
well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they
will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around,
or spitting nasty goo.

All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed,
attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering
monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are
attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will
arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent)
will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit.
This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.

A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to
30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the
beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent
creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits,
the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from
the impact.

Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its
digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can
perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack
will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in
which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their
nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next
round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an
attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical
bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack
hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do
anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.

Cavemen are a species closely related to humans; they are
shorter and stockier, and much more heavily muscled. They do

Centaurs appear to be half man, half horse, having the torso,
arms and head of a man in the position a horse's head would
otherwise occupy. A centaur is as big as a heavy horse, but
much taller and slightly heavier; average males are about 7
feet tall and weigh about 2,100 pounds, and females are just a
bit smaller. Centaurs may charge with a spear or lance just as
a man on horseback, with the same bonuses.

Centaurs are generally haughty and aloof, but very honorable.
Most would rather die than allow humans, demi-humans, or
humanoids to ride on their backs.

Giant centipedes are larger versions of the normal sort.
Centipedes are fast-moving, predatory, venomous arthropods,
having long segmented bodies with exoskeletons. They prefer to
live in underground areas, shadowy forested areas, and other
places out of direct sunlight; however, there are
desert-dwelling varieties that hide under the sand waiting for
prey to wander by.

Giant centipedes tend to attack anything that resembles food,
biting with their jaws and injecting their poison. Those bitten

Chimeras are strange creatures having a lion's body with the
heads of a lion, a goat, and a dragon, and the wings of a
dragon. A chimera is about 5 feet tall at the shoulder, nearly
10 feet long, and weighs about 4,000 pounds. A chimera’s dragon
head might be black, blue, green, red, or white, and has the
same type of breath weapon as that sort of dragon. Regardless
of type, the dragon's head breathes a 50' long cone with a 10'
wide end, for 3d6 points of damage; victims may save vs. Dragon

A cockatrice is a strange creature, appearing to be a chicken
(hen or rooster) with a long serpentine neck and tail; the neck
is topped by a more or less normal looking chicken head.

A male cockatrice has wattles and a comb, just like a rooster.
Females, much rarer than males, differ only in that they have
no wattles or comb. A cockatrice weighs about 25 pounds. A
cockatrice is no more intelligent than any animal, but they are
bad-tempered and prone to attack if disturbed.

Anyone touched by a cockatrice, or who touches one (even if

Giant crabs naturally resemble the ordinary variety, but are
much larger, averaging 5' in diameter (not counting their
legs). These creatures are often found in water-filled caves,
particularly those connected to a river, lake or sea, and are
tolerant of both fresh and salt water. Also, they are able to
live in stagnant water, though they prefer a better
environment.

Giant crabs carry their eyes on armored stalks, which means that
no bonus is awarded for attacking them from behind.

Displacers are blue-black, catlike monsters with strange bladed
arms extending from the shoulders. The blades are carried
folded back like wings, but the Displacer swings the blades
around in front to attack.

The real power and danger of the Displacer is its power of
displacement, which causes the monster's apparent location to
shift around constantly over a range of 3' from the monster's
true location. This is a form of illusion, but a powerful form
that cannot be seen through even by those who know the secret.

Any character fighting a Displacer for the first time will miss
his or her first strike regardless of the die roll. Thereafter,
all attacks against displacers will be at a penalty of -2 to the
attack roll. This is not cumulative with the penalty for
fighting blind. Some monsters, such as bats, do not depend on
vision to fight and thus may be able to perceive the monster's
true location and fight without penalty.

The djinn (singular djinni) are humanoid creatures from the
Elemental Plane of Air. A djinni in its natural form is about
10½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical
powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched
in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind (see
below) to harass those who follow; the 12 morale reflects a
djinni's absolute control over its own fear, but does not
indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use
the “8” figure to determine whether an outmatched djinn decides
to leave a combat.

Djinn have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will
(that is, without needing magic words or gestures): create food
and drink, creating tasty and nourishing food for up to 2d6
humans or similar creatures, once per day; become invisible,
with unlimited uses per day; create normal items, creating up
to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of permanent
nature or metal goods lasting at most a day, once per day;
assume gaseous form, as the potion, up to one hour per day; and
create illusions, as the spell phantasmal force but including
sound as well as visual elements, three times per day.

Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with no limit
as to the number of times per day this power may be used; a
djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it were an air elemental.

[-- Image: graphics10 --]Due to their highly magical nature,
djinn cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune
to normal cold, and suffer only half damage from magical
attacks based on either cold or wind.

Normal dogs include most medium and large breeds, including wild
dogs. After biting an opponent, a dog can hold on, doing 1d4
damage automatically every round, until killed or until the
victim spends an attack breaking free (which requires a save
vs. Death Ray, adjusted by the character's Strength bonus).

Riding dogs are a large breed, used primarily by Halflings for
transport. They may be trained for war, and equipped with
barding to improve their Armor Class. They can maintain a hold
in the same way that normal dogs do. A light load for a riding
dog is up to 150 pounds; a heavy load, up to 300 pounds.

Dopplegangers are strange beings that are able to take on the
shapes of those they encounter; they can also read minds (as
the spell, ESP, but with no limit of duration). In its natural
form, the creature looks more or less humanoid, but slender and
frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed features. The flesh is
pale and hairless. Its large, bulging eyes are yellow with
slitted pupils. A doppleganger is hardy, with a natural agility
not in keeping with its frail appearance. In its natural form a
doppleganger is about 5½ feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.

Dopplegangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to
stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society.
Although not usually evil, they are interested only in
themselves and regard all others as playthings to be
manipulated and deceived.

When in its natural form, a doppleganger strikes with its
powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed
person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such
cases, it uses its mind reading power to employ the same tactics
and strategies as the person it is impersonating.

Dragon

Dragons are large (sometimes very large) winged reptilian
monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four legs as well as two
wings; this is how experts distinguish “true” dragons from other
large reptilian monsters. All dragons are long-lived, and they
grow slowly for as long as they live. For this reason, they are
described as having seven “age categories,” ranging from 3 less
to 3 more hit dice than the average. For convenience, a table
is provided following the description of each dragon type; this
table shows the variation in hit dice, damage from their various
attacks, and other features peculiar to dragons.

If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male
or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a
mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or
four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or
two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the
parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are
protecting their young.

A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long,
whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It
prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has
worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with
spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent
dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating
the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking
off weaker enemies).

Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as
it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category
do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more
often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws
and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be
used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws
may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature.
Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any
direction, even behind them.

The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit
die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its
breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half
damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction
around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the
dragon can bite those behind it.

There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's
breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape,
which that type of dragon can use from the second age category
(-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2
hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one
of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category
(+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three
shapes.

The shapes are:

Cone Shaped: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and
is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum
length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum
width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and
age).

Line Shaped: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given
length in a straight line.

Cloud Shaped: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum
given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length
and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type
and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most,
20' deep or high.

All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able
to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;”
this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a
demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn
Elvish. If the first roll for “talking” is successful, the GM
may roll again, with each additional roll adding another
language which the dragon may speak.

Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can
cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn
to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for
separately.

[-- Image: graphics18 --]Although goals and ideals vary among
varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth,
collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels,
and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath
to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to
patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is
no such thing as enough treasure. It’s pleasing to look at, and
they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their
hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note
that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair
of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a
single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do
not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts
for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a
dragon of the highest age category would have about double the
given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category
would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no
treasure).

Tales are told of the adventurers who subdued various dragons.
Such stories are usually exaggerations. If players care to try,
the dragon may in fact seem to give up and become docile. As
soon as it recovers from the mistreatment, the dragon will try
to find a way to escape the player characters, retrieve its
treasure, and possibly seek revenge. Out of pride, a dragon
will never seek assistance from its own kind in this case, but
might “use” humanoids or other monsters to attack the party.

Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their
surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps
and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground;
trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability.
When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight,
so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.
Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still
motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect
valuable items.

Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part
of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey
comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this
case).

Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon
may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait
underwater.

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying
in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match
the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their
advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot
in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into
the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until
opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack
(surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also
store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks
valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue
dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons.
They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering
their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and
killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon
will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with
that person as a cat plays with a mouse.

Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only
half damage from magical lightning.

Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. Those having
spellcasting ability make heavy use of spells in combat. Among
their favorites are cloudkill, sleep, and slow.

All gold dragons have the power to assume human form at will (in
a manner equivalent to the spell polymorph self, but performed
at will).

Unlike many other dragons, gold dragons are not cruel and do not
seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of gold dragons
offering assistance to adventurers. They are, however, every
bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold
need not bother asking for a loan.

Gold dragons are immune to all poisons, as well as normal fire.
They suffer only half damage from magical fire.

Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation,
picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing
or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to
determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate
tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes
its presence known quickly – it enjoys evoking terror.

Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn
more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the
countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be
allowed to live so long as they remain interesting… but woe to
them when the dragon becomes bored.

Green dragons are immune to all poisons.

Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to
appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap
decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked
out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak
creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them
with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they
might be carrying.

Red dragons are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt,
torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures. They are often
said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a red dragon will
attack almost any creature less powerful than itself.

Red dragons are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half
damage from magical fire.

Though they live in the water, and are somewhat adapted to it,
Sea Dragons still must breathe air, similar to dolphins or
whales. A Sea Dragon may hold its breath up to three turns
while swimming or performing other moderate activity.

Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, similar to white dragons.
They often maintain lairs in air-filled undersea caverns.

White Dragons prefer to live in cold regions, whether in the
highest mountains or in the cold northern lands. They are the
least intelligent of dragons, though this does not mean that
they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are
motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of
course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for
pleasure.

White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft
or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their
icy breath weapon, then try to knock out a single opponent with
a follow-up attack.

White dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only half
damage from magical cold or ice.

A dragon turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color
as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights
that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The
turtle’s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with
golden highlights. An adult dragon turtle can measure from 100
to 200 feet from snout to tail. They are occasionally mistaken
for rocky outcroppings or even small islands.

Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and generally attack any
creature that threatens their territory or looks like a
potential meal. Though they are not true dragons, they do
advance through the same sort of age categories as the true
dragons do; however, each age category changes the dragon
turtle's Hit Dice by 5.

Due to their massive size, dragon turtles are immune to
virtually all poisons.

[-- Image: graphics23 --]Dryads are female nature spirits; each
is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must
never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill
and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic.
A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies;
likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.

A dryad’s delicate features are much like a female elf's, though
her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a
canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. Although
they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been
encountered in one place on rare occasions.

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they
are alluring -- they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen
unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a
dryad can charm (as the spell charm person), attempting to gain
control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the
rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into
a frenzied defense.

The efreet (singular efreeti) are humanoid creatures from the
Elemental Plane of Fire. An efreeti in its natural form stands
about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet are
malicious by nature. They love to mislead, befuddle, and
confuse their foes. They do this for enjoyment as much as for
tactical reasons.

[-- Image: graphics7 --]Note that the 12 morale reflects an
efreeti's absolute control over its own fear, but does not
indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily. Use
the “9” figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti
decides to leave a combat.

Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at
will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become
invisible, with unlimited uses per day; assume gaseous form, as
the potion, up to one hour per day; create illusions, as the
spell phantasmal force but including sound as well as visual
elements, three times per day; create flame, with unlimited
uses; and create a wall of fire (as the spell), once per day.

Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no
limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used;
an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.

Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by
non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal fire, and suffer
only half damage from magical fire attacks.

Elemental*

Elementals are incarnations of the elements that compose
existence.

It is possible to summon an elemental by one of three means: By
the use of a staff, or of a device, or by casting a spell. For
each elemental type, separate statistics are provided for each
of these three categories.

Due to their highly magical nature, elementals cannot be harmed
by non-magical weapons.

Air elementals resemble “dust devils,” that is, small
whirlwinds, but they are much more powerful. Air elementals
take double damage when attacked by earth-based attacks
(including by earth elementals). An air elemental may choose
either to attack a single opponent, thus receiving one attack
per round at the listed damage, or may choose to knock all
opponents in a 5' radius to the ground; if the latter attack is
used, all creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save vs. Death
Ray or fall prone. Creatures of 3 or more levels or hit dice
are not so affected. Air elementals do an additional 1d8 points
of damage against creatures or vehicles which are airborne.

Fire elementals are simply flames, which may appear generally
humanoid for brief moments when they attack. Fire elementals
take double damage when attacked by water (including water
elementals). They cannot cross a body of water wider than their
own diameter. They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against
creatures which are cold or icy in nature.

Remember that a fire elemental is burning; such a creature may
easily start fires if it moves into an area containing items
which burn easily, such as dry wood, paper, or oil. No specific
rules are given for such fires, but the GM is directed to the
rules for burning oil for an example of fire damage.

Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water. Huge
barracudas are about 12' long, while giant specimens can exceed
20'. They have elongated bodies, pointed heads and prominent
jaws. Their bodies are covered with smooth scales, typically
blue, gray or silver in color. They have extremely keen
eyesight and are surprised only on a 1 on 1d6. Due to the
quickness of their attack, barracudas are themselves capable of
surprising on 1-3 on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.

Giant barracudas always appear singly and are 50% likely to
break off the attack after 1d4 rounds if they haven't killed
their prey. Both kinds are attracted to shiny objects.

Giant bass are generally between 10' and 25' long. Most are
greenish-grey, marked with dark lateral stripes, though some
are almost completely black. They are generally found in lakes
or rivers, as they are not adapted for salt water.

Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of 20 a
giant bass will swallow whole a dwarf-sized or smaller
creature, which then takes 2d4 damage per round until it is
dead. Swallowed characters can attack only with daggers or
similar short weapons. Note that each giant bass can swallow at
most one character, and a giant bass which has swallowed a
character will attempt to retreat (having achieved its goal).

Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that causes a
painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a save vs. Poison
is failed. The pain causes the affected character or creature
to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws;
further poisonings will increase this penalty by -1 each, down
to a maximum penalty of -5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the
duration of the poison effect.

[-- Image: graphics62 --]Because of their size and body design,
a giant catfish cannot target more than one of its attacks on
any single creature; that is, it cannot bite and fin the same
opponent, nor use both fins on one victim.

are predators, but will normally only attack creatures smaller
than themselves. Giant toads are statistically just like giant
frogs; however, they are often found in “drier” areas as they
do not have to maintain a wet skin surface.

A giant frog can stretch its tongue out up to 15' and drag up to
dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every subsequent round, the
victim is hit automatically. On a natural 20 attack roll, the
victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6 damage per round
thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only one such victim.

Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can
perch indefinitely without moving and use this disguise to
surprise their foes. They are cruel monsters, inflicting pain
on other creatures for the sole purpose of enjoyment.

Gargoyles require no food, water, or air. Due to their
highly-magical nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical
weapons.

The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along
dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion,
creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and
visible inside the cube’s body. A typical gelatinous cube is
ten feet on a side and weighs about 15,000 pounds; however,
smaller specimens have been reported. A gelatinous cube attacks
by slamming its body into its prey. It is capable of lashing out
with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes.

Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature,
which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.

Ghouls are undead monsters which eat the flesh of dead humanoids
to survive. They are vile, disgusting carrion-eaters, but are
more than willing to kill for food. Those slain by ghouls will
generally be stored until they begin to rot before the ghouls
will actually eat them.

Those hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack must save vs.
Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to
this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever
possible, striking from behind tombstones and bursting from
shallow graves; when these methods are employed, they are able
to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may
be Turned by Clerics and are immune to sleep, charm and hold
magics.

Humanoids bitten by ghouls may be infected with ghoul fever.
Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 5% chance of the
infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to
save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies
within a day.

[-- Image: graphics28 --]An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghoul
fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who
becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it
possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other
ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves
like a normal ghoul in all respects.

Cloud giants’ skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky
blue. They have hair of silvery white or brass, and their eyes
are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and
weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and
lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.

[-- Image: graphics30 --]

Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear
jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the
clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the
wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or
more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Like most giants,
they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do
not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand
tribute from humans, demi-humans, or humanoids living nearby.

Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully
developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position
above their opponents. Cloud giants can throw large stones up
to 200' for 3d6 points of damage each. Also, 5% of cloud giants
have the abilities of a Magic-User of level 2 to 8 (2d4). A
favorite tactic is to circle the enemies, barraging them with
rocks while the giants with magical abilities confound them
with spells.

measures 9 feet around, and weighs about 3,200 pounds. Females
are slightly shorter and lighter. Fire giants can live to be

garments colored red, orange, yellow, or black. Warriors wear
helmets and half-plate armor of blackened steel.

with horns or feathers.

An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800
pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise
identical with males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.

Frost giants are, first and foremost, cunning. They dislike the
smaller races as much as any giant, but rather than attacking
outright they will try to use their advantages to convince
those weaker than them to submit. If faced with a stronger
force, frost giants will parley or withdraw if possible,
attacking only if victory seems assured.

Adult storm giants are about 21 feet tall and weigh about 12,000
pounds. They can live to be 600 years old. Most storm giants
have pale skin and dark hair. Very rarely, storm giants have
violet skin. Violet-skinned storm giants have deep violet or
blue-black hair with silvery gray or purple eyes.

Storm giants generally dress in short, loose tunic belted at the
waist, sandals or bare feet, and a headband. They wear a few
pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, anklets (favored
by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. They
live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about
the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land
or gathering food.

Storm giants prefer to attack first with their lightning bolts
(which work just as the spell does, and can be used once per
five rounds; a save vs. Spells reduces damage to half). Also,
10% of storm giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of level
2 to 12 (2d6).

Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose
tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. An
adult male gnoll is about 7½ feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

Gnolls are nocturnal carnivores, preferring intelligent
creatures for food because they scream more. They show little
discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader.

[-- Image: graphics12 --]One out of every six gnolls will be a
hardened warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) having a +1 bonus to

as long as the pack leader is alive. In addition, a lair has a
chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present, and 1 on
1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hardened

Gnomes stand 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their
skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is
fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually
wear short, carefully trimmed beards.

[-- Image: graphics25 --]Gnomes generally wear leather or earth
tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate
stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age
40, and they live about 350 years.

Gnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the
language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome
lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in
gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in
the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile.
They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races.
When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will
generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount
of treasure.

Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the
statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior
there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice
and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of
every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice
(145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led
by a sergeant. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen
warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor
Class of 16 (11). In addition, in communities of 35 or greater,
there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor
Class of 18 (11) having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In
their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as
the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a

Goblins are small, wicked humanoids that favor ambushes,
overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can
devise. An adult goblin stands 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40
to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking,
varying in color from red to yellow. A goblin’s skin color
ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red;
usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color.
Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab,
soiled-looking colors.

The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather
armor with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30'
and a natural Armor Class of 11.

Some goblins ride dire wolves into combat, and large groups of
goblins will often employ them to track and attack their foes.

One out of every eight goblins will be a warrior of 3-3 Hit Dice
(145 XP). Goblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are
led by a warrior. In a lair or other settlement, one out of
every fifteen will be a chieftain of 5-5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with
an Armor Class of 15 (11) that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to
strength. In lairs or settlements of 30 or more goblins, there
will be a goblin king of 7-7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor
Class of 16 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage. Goblins have
a +2 bonus to morale while their king is present (this is not
cumulative with the bonus given by a warrior leader). In
addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman
being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a goblin king is present). A
shaman is equivalent to a regular goblin statistically, but has
Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

Golem*

Golems are magically created automatons of great power.
Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and
elemental forces. The animating force for a golem is an
elemental spirit. The process of creating the golem binds the
spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of
the golem’s creator.

Being mindless, golems generally do nothing without orders from
their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are
incapable of any strategy or tactics. A golem’s creator can
command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear
its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last
instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it
returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple
command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The
golem’s creator can order the golem to obey the commands of
another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone
else’s control, and so on), but the golem’s creator can always
resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to
obey him alone.

Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects,
except when otherwise noted. They can only be hit by magical
weapons.

damage for every 3 full points of damage the attack would

Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created from the
skeletons of at least two dead humanoids. Though made of bone,
they are not undead and cannot be turned.

Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed
with two two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a
damage figure of 1d10/1d10 or by weapon.

When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance
each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem
goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage,
attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object
smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving
on to spread more destruction. The golem’s creator, if within 60
feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and
persuasively to the golem; he or she must make a save vs.

These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike natural
bronze statues, they never turn green from verdigris. A bronze
golem is 10 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. A bronze
golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have
any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth
gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.

The interior of a bronze golem is molten metal. Creatures hit by
one in combat suffer an additional 1d10 damage from the heat
(unless resistant to heat or fire). If one is hit in combat,
molten metal spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage.
A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid the metal spray.

golem cannot speak, although it can emit a hoarse roar of

When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1%

This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can
be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below),
although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its
features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron
golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem
is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem
cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any
distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth
gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.

Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a
10-foot cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of
effect must save vs. Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be
used up to 3 times per day.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron
golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A
magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on
the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 full points of
damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing
would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, the

gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 19 points. An

9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is
frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might
look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved
on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of
its limbs.

Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful
and difficult to harm. A stone golem can use a slow effect, as
the spell, once every other round; a save vs. Spells is allowed
to resist. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of
2d6 rounds.

A stone to flesh spell may be used to weaken the monster. The
spell does not actually change the golem’s structure, but for
one full round after being affected, the golem is vulnerable to
normal weapons. The stone golem is allowed a save vs. Spells to
resist.

Wood golems are small constructs, not more than 4' in height,
and are crudely made. Being made of wood makes them vulnerable
to fire-based attacks; thus, wood golems suffer one extra point
of damage per die from fire; any saving throws against such
effects are at a penalty of -2. They move stiffly, suffering a
-1 penalty to Initiative.

Gorgons are magical monsters resembling bulls made of iron.
Their breath can turn living creatures to stone; it covers an
area 60' long by 10' wide, and can be used as many times per
day as the monster has hit dice, but no more often than every
other round. A save vs. Petrification is allowed to resist.

A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder,
measures 8 feet from snout to tail, and weighs about 4,000
pounds. Gorgons are nothing if not aggressive. They attack
intruders on sight, attempting to gore or petrify them. There
is no way to calm these furious creatures, and they are
impossible to domesticate.

Gray oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They
inhabit underground areas, scouring caverns, ruins, and
dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. A gray
ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of
about 6 inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.

A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves
organic material and metal, but not stone. After a successful
hit, the ooze will stick to the creature attacked, dealing 2d8
damage per round automatically. Normal (non-magical) armor or
clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately. A
non-magical metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze
also dissolves immediately. Magical weapons, armor, and
clothing are allowed a saving throw (use the wearer's save vs.
Death Ray, adding any magical “plus” value to the roll if
applicable).

Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and
is even capable of dissolving metal given enough time. Bright
green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and
ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter.
It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and
possible food) below. Green slime cannot grow in sunlight; even
the indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and
prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill green
slime outright within a turn.

On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a
creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but
after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing the
same damage to both the victim and the slime). A cure disease
spell will destroy a patch of green slime. It does not harm
stone or enchanted metal, but can dissolve normal metal or
enchanted wood in a turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.

If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds, the victim
will be completely transformed into green slime; such a
character or creature cannot be retrieved by any magic short of
a wish.

Griffons are large carnivorous creatures resembling lions with
the head, foreclaws and wings of eagles. From nose to tail, an
adult griffon can measure as much as 8 feet. Neither males nor
females are endowed with a mane. A pair of broad, golden wings
emerge from the creature’s back and span 25 feet or more. An
adult griffon weighs about 500 pounds.

[-- Image: graphics46 --]Griffons nest on high mountaintops,
soaring down to feed on horses, the beast’s preferred prey.
They hunt and travel in ocks. A Griffon will attack a horse
over anything else, diving low to swipe with their claws. They
are not above retreating and coming back later, when there may
be less of a defense mounted.

Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity, but
even in this case they may try to attack horses if any come
within about 120'. Roll a morale check in this case; if the
check is failed, the griffon will try to attack immediately. A
light load for a griffon is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, up
to 600 pounds; and a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hangman trees are horrible, semi-animate creatures that
fertilize themselves with dead bodies. A hangman tree has four
animated limbs that can wrap around the necks of living
creatures that pass beneath, strangling for 1d6 points of
damage per round. These limbs are arranged evenly around the
tree in most cases, and generally no more than one limb can
attack any single creature at a time.

[-- Image: graphics26 --]The roots of this tree are also
animated; they do not attack, but they do pull dead bodies
below the surface of the ground for “digestion.”

[-- Image: graphics48 --]A harpy looks like a giant vulture
bearing the torso and face of a human female. They are able to
attack with their claws as well as with normal weapons, but
their most insidious ability is their song. When a harpy sings,
all creatures (other than harpies) within a 300' radius must
succeed on a save vs. Spells or become charmed. The same
harpy’s song cannot affect a creature that successfully saves
again for 24 hours. A charmed victim walks toward the harpy,
taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into
a dangerous area (through ame, off a cliff, or the like), that
creature is allowed a second saving throw to resist the charm.
Charmed creatures can take no actions other than to defend
themselves. A victim within reach of the harpy stands there and
offers no resistance to the monster’s attacks. The effect
continues for as long as the harpy sings, and for one round
thereafter.

Hellhounds are canine creatures sheathed in hellish flame. A
typical hell hound stands 4½ feet high at the shoulder and
weighs 120 pounds. They are native to another plane, where they
roam freely, or are sometimes used as watchdogs. In the wild,
these creatures travel and hunt in packs. They have a breath
weapon, a flaming attack that may be used against a single
creature. One-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6), a hellhound will
choose to breathe fire; otherwise the hellhound will use its
bite. Roll each round to determine which is used. If the
hellhound breathes fire, its victim may save vs. Dragon Breath
for half damage. Each hellhound may breathe fire a number of
times per day equal to its hit dice.

Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice
each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the
hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3. A hellhound has an
Armor Class equal to 11 plus its hit dice.

Hippogriffs resemble large ying horses with the forefront of a
bird of prey. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a
wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.

A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other
creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes. Griffons sometimes
attack them, and hippogriffs will generally attack those
creatures on sight.

Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense,
save for those times a griffon is met. They are prized as
flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are relatively safe
around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise one in
captivity in order to use it as a mount. A light load for a
hippogriff is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, up to 600
pounds; and a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hobgoblins are larger cousins of goblins, being about the same
size as humans. Their hair color ranges from dark reddish-brown
to dark gray. They have dark orange or red-orange skin. Large
males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblins' eyes are yellowish or
dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to
be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather.
Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair.

Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating warriors, always looking to
exploit those weaker than themselves. They have a strong grasp
of strategy and tactics and are capable of carrying out
sophisticated battle plans. Under the leadership of a skilled
strategist or tactician, their discipline can prove a deciding
factor. Hobgoblins hate elves and attack them first in
preference over other opponents.

[-- Image: graphics50 --]One out of every six hobgoblins will be
a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1
bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In
hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of
5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 15 (11) having a +1
bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater,
there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an
Armor Class of 16 (11) having a +2 bonus to damage. In the
lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king
is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6
of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is
present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman is
equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior statistically, but has
Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A witch or warlock is
equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has Magic-User abilities
of level 1d6.

Hydras are reptile-like monsters with multiple heads. They are
gray-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow or tan
underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are yellow-white.
Hydras are about 20 feet long and weigh about 4,000 pounds.
They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not particularly
cunning.

A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however,
most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a
character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a
particular head, and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that
head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be
able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the
monster's total hit points, of course.

Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a
swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few
hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit
a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This
attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it
is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such
attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing
the amount by half.

An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large
group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit.
In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes,
though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in
order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If
the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10'
squares and the flying movement above is ignored.

Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm
suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are
doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not
wear armor, any creature having less than Armor Class 15 is
considered unarmored).

Damage is reduced to a single point per round for three rounds
if the character manages to exit the swarm. It is possible to
“ward off” the insects by swinging a weapon, shield, or other
similar-sized object around, and in this case also damage is
reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit torch is used in this
way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round. Weapons, even magic
weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An entire swarm can be
affected by a sleep spell. Smoke can be used to drive a swarm
away (if the swarm moves away from the victim(s) due to smoke,
the damage stops immediately). Finally, a victim who dives into
water will take damage for only one more round.

Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane
of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon
them to perform specific tasks.

A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the
summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or
thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until
the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it
resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to
pervert its instructions accordingly.

Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A detect invisible
spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud. Don't forget to
apply the standard penalty of -4 on the attack die when an
invisible stalker is attacked by a creature which is unable to
see it.

[-- Image: graphics51 --]Kobolds are small, dog-faced reptilian
humanoids. A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45
pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can
see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can,
kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive
enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour
flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin
onto them. Kobolds suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in
bright sunlight or within the radius of light spells.

One out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25
XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by
a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a
chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11)
and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30
or greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP),
with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and having a +1 bonus to damage.
In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check as long as the
kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to
1 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold
king is present). A shaman is equivalent to a regular kobold
statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

Kobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies,
and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However,
they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat,
leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them
directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive
dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how
to avoid.

Living Statue

Living statues are magically animated. They are true automatons,
unlike golems, which are animated by elemental spirits. While
this means that living statues have no chance of going

meaningful fashion. They make very effective guards for tombs,
treasure rooms, and similar places.

Living statues can be crafted to resemble any sort of living

A lizard man is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or
brown scales. Its tail is used for balance and is 3 to 4 feet
long. Adult males can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds. Due to
their great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage done
with melee weapons.

Lizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for
an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot
swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water
even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and
eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile). When they are able to
employ this maneuver, lizard men surprise on 1-4 on 1d6.

[-- Image: graphics3 --]Lizard men are largely indifferent to
other races, being primarily interested in their own survival.
If aroused, however, they are fearsome warriors, using simple
but sound tactics.

Lycanthrope*

Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves into
animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any
other human, though those who have been afflicted for a long
time tend to acquire features reminiscent of their animal
forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful
version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes
(which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of
unnatural intelligence.

Lycanthropy is spread like a disease. Any human who loses half
or more of his or her hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or
claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of
lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For demi-humans and humanoids,
contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A
cure disease cast before the onset is complete will stop the
progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the
transformation is permanent.

In animal form, lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or
magical weapons.

Werebears are humans that can transform into large bears. When
in human form, they typically appear as well-muscled, imposing

A wererat in human form tends to be a thin, wiry individual of
shorter than average height, with eyes constantly darting
around. A wererat's nose and mouth may twitch if he or she is
excited. Males often wear thin, ragged mustaches.

In addition to assuming the form of a giant rat, wererats can
assume an intermediate form (a “ratman”). The ratman form
shares the animal form's immunity to normal weapons, and can
deliver an identical bite, but in this form the wererat may use
a normal weapon instead of biting. Note that the wererat in
ratman form cannot bite and use a weapon in the same round.

[-- Image: graphics49 --]Wererats, unlike most lycanthropes,
prefer to inhabit civilized areas, particularly cities. They
frequently lair in sewers or other underground areas, coming
out by night to steal from or kill city folk.

A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from
her head instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any
creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrification is made.
In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its
gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting
their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC.
It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other
reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa
suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a
medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrification
itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others,
but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to
petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid
mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their
eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the
monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.

Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save
vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not
individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).

A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding
its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet
tall and about the same weight as a human.

Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that,
once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will
not rest until she is slain. They are hateful creatures,
however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can
without being discovered.

Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of
dolphins. Also called “sirens,” mermaids often attempt to lure
sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this
by means of their enchanting songs.

A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but
generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect
must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward
the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two
mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more
than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to
anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might
be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.

Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half
fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for
up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of
strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two
turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per
turn.

Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds
ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can
produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means
that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and
whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one
or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.

Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter
which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will
either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans,
depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born
with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A
small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often
form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their
leader. Such a group is called a pod.

One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can
sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids
usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close
friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number
appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.

A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as
they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the
attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any
pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number
rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only
in groups of 1 or 2.

Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers. They hunt fish
and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids are sometimes more than 1
hit die, and about 3% have Clerical abilities.

nixies are female. Most nixies are slim and comely, with

twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps
woven from colorful seaweed. Nixies prefer not to leave their
lakes. A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45
pounds.

Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm
(similar to charm person). The charm lasts one year (unless
dispelled). A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. Each nixie
can cast water breathing once per day, with a duration of one
day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of
giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see

Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable. However, they

ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists
of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally
repellent odor. Ogres are brutish and aggressive, but
inherently lazy. They employ direct attacks in combat,
typically using large clubs, axes, or pole arms, generally
causing 2d6 damage. If normal weapons are employed, an ogre has
a +3 bonus to damage due to strength. If an ogre fights
bare-handed, it does 1d8 subduing damage per hit.

One out of every six ogres will be a pack leader of 6+1 Hit Dice

black hair (but very little body hair). An adult male orc is a

are slightly smaller. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that
many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red,
mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. They utilize all
manner of weapons and armor scavenged from battlefields.

Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60'. They suffer a -1 attack

language, but many also speak some common or goblin.

[-- Image: graphics56 --]One out of every eight orcs will be a

Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely

in diameter and 60-100 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds.

The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail; those injured
by it must save vs. Poison or die. Note that the purple worm's
movement is less than the monster's length, so that, if
attacking from out of a tunnel, it might not be able to use the
stinger for several rounds.

Any time a purple worm successfully bites a man-sized or smaller
opponent with a natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been
swallowed, and will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due
to being digested. A character who has been swallowed can only

These omnivorous rodents thrive almost anywhere. Normal rats
attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm
reduces their numbers by one animal.

Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests
and territories. A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long
and weigh over 50 pounds. A single giant rat, or a small group
of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack
fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.

Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease. A character
who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates
disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will
lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each
point, the character is allowed a save vs. Death Ray (adjusted
by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the
fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero
Constitution is dead. See Constitution Point Losses in the
Encounter section for details on regaining lost Constitution.

* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or
killing an entire pack of normal size. If the adventurers are
forced to flee, the GM should award 3 XP per rat slain.

The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and scorpions, though
it is not properly either. Rhagodessas have “pedipalps,” an
elongated extra pair of legs in front that have sticky pads on
them for capturing prey.

Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert
terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while
those found underground may be black or white in color (those
found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders,
they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or
otherwise climb entirely upside down.

A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast, and
will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth the next round and
automatically hit for 2d8 damage. The rhagodessa will not use
its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way,
and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If
threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will
attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.

The rhinoceros is infamous for its bad temper and willingness to
charge intruders.

The statistics presented here are based on the African black
rhino, which is 6 to 14 feet long, 3 to 6 feet high at the
shoulder, and weighs up to 6,000 pounds. These statistics can
describe any herbivore of similar size and similar natural
weapons (antlers, horns, tusks, or the like).

The woolly rhinoceros is a prehistoric beast with long fur,
found in primitive “lost world” areas in colder territories.
They behave much as the black rhino does.

Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a “normal” roc is
huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan of 24 feet.
Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around
48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive
wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark
brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males
have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color
and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be
hidden, that is).

A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load
is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope
to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up
to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1200. Giant rocs can
easily lift up to 3000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when
carrying up to 6000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off
full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a
young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous
birds.

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in
its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to
devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks
against a single creature results in that creature being
carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the
roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be
further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given
to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is
solitary). A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack
any man-sized or larger creature that appears edible. A mated
pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend
their nests or hatchlings.

The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan
underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster’s prehensile
antennae can rust metals on contact. The typical rust monster
measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing 200 pounds.

A rust monster's touch transforms metal objects into rust (or
verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal
attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such
as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A
non-magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half
damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one
“plus” each time they make contact with the rust monster;
this loss is permanent.

[-- Image: graphics33 --]The metal oxides created by this
monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in
its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored
characters. Use a morale check to determine this.

Salamanders are large, lizard-like creatures from the elemental
planes. They are sometimes found on the material plane; they
can arrive through naturally-occurring dimensional rifts, or
they may be summoned by high-level Magic-Users. Due to their
highly magical nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical
weapons.

Flame salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Fire. They
look like giant snakes, more than 12' long, with dragonlike
heads and lizard forelimbs. Their scales are all the colors of
flame, red and orange and yellow. A flame salamander is flaming
hot, and all non-fire-resistant creatures within 20' of the
monster suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the heat.
They are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack. Flame
salamanders are intelligent; they speak the language of the
Plane of Fire, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or
Dragon.

Frost salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Water. They
look like giant lizards with six legs. Their scales are the
colors of ice, white, pale gray and pale blue. Frost
salamanders are very cold, and all non-cold-resistant creatures
within 20' suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the cold.
Frost salamanders are completely immune to all types of
cold-based attacks. They are quite intelligent; all speak the
language of the Plane of Water, and many also speak Common,
Elvish, and/or Dragon.

Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each type will
attack the other on sight, in preference over any other foe. If
summoned by a Magic-User, a salamander is often assigned to
protect a location, doorway, or treasure hoard; in such a case,
the salamander will attack anyone attempting to gain
unauthorized access to the protected area. Those which arrive
through natural rifts may have any goals or motivations the GM
wishes, and thus may choose to parley, fight, or even ignore
adventurers.

A shadow can be difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas but
stands out starkly in brightly illuminated places. They lurk in
dark places, waiting for living prey to happen by. A shadow is 5
to 6 feet tall and is weightless. Shadows cannot speak
intelligibly. Despite their strange nature and appearance,
shadows are not undead monsters, and thus cannot be Turned by a
Cleric.

A shadow's attack does 1d4 damage (from cold) and drains 1 point
of Strength from the victim. Victims reduced to 2 or fewer
points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those
reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at
nightfall). Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are
recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.

[-- Image: graphics35 --]Due to their incorporeal nature,
shadows cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

Giant shrews resemble giant rats, but are larger, being up to 6'
long, and darker in color. They have a very fast metabolic rate
and must eat almost constantly. Giant shrews are omnivorous,
and aggressively defend their nests and the immediate territory
around them.

Giant shrews move so swiftly that they are able to bite twice
per round, and they may attack two different adjacent opponents
in this way.

A few giant shrew species (generally no more than 5% of those
encountered) are venomous. The bite of such a giant shrew will
kill the victim unless a save vs. Poison is made. A victim
bitten twice in a round need only save once for that round, but
of course will have to save again in subsequent rounds if bitten
again. Venomous giant shrews are considered 1* with respect to
hit dice.

A shrieker is a large, semi-mobile fungus that emits a loud
noise to attract prey or when disturbed. Shriekers live in
dark, subterranean places. They come in several shades of
purple.

A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures monsters to
its vicinity by emitting a loud noise. Movement or a light
source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a
piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts
nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some
creatures that live near shriekers learn that the fungus’ noise
means there is food nearby. In game terms, the GM should roll a
wandering monster check each round that a shrieker shrieks.

Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes. There are many varieties
ranging in size from 2' to 12' at adulthood; the statistics
above are for an “average” variety which reaches about 9' in
length.

Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive “pits” between
their eyes and nostrils. These are used to detect birds,
mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes. Note
that, even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can
still sense them because their temperature will often be
slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.

Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the

Tentacle worms appear to be giant worms of some sort. Their

A titanothere is a huge prehistoric animal; adults average 10'
tall and 13' long. They resemble the rhinoceros, but have
large, forked horns rather than the pointed horns of rhinos.
Like rhinos, they are herd animals, and males aggressively
defend the herd; females only enter combat if the male(s) are
defeated or the attackers are very numerous. If a single
titanothere is encountered, it will be a rogue male; they are
bad tempered and prone to attacking smaller creatures that
enter their territory.

[-- Image: graphics2 --]A treant is a large, roughly humanoid
tree-man. Treants have leaves of deep green in the spring and
summer. In the fall and winter the leaves change to yellow,
orange, or red, but they rarely fall out. A treant’s legs fit
together when closed to look like the trunk of a tree, and a
motionless treant is nearly indistinguishable from a tree. A
treant is about 30 feet tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in
diameter. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.

Treants speak their own language, plus Common and Elvish. Most
also can manage a smattering of just about all other humanoid
tongues, at least enough to say “Get away from my trees!”
Treants prefer to watch potential foes carefully before
attacking. They often charge suddenly from cover to trample the
despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed, they animate trees as
reinforcements.

A treant can animate trees within 180' at will, controlling up
to two trees at a time. It takes one round for a normal tree to
uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10' and fights
as a treant in all respects. Such trees lose their ability to
move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves
out of range.

lizardlike humanoid creatures. They have large red eyes and
spiny “combs” on their legs, head, and arms. They normally
stand 5 to 6 feet tall. They can change color at will, and 50%
of the time a group can blend into the environment well enough
to surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Furthermore, they gain a
+2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their
excellent ambush skills.

Troglodytes are very hostile, attacking equal or weaker
non-troglodyte groups on sight. They prefer to attack with
surprise, depending on their color-changing ability for this.

One out of every eight troglodytes will be a warrior of 4 Hit

Troglodytes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by
a warrior. In lairs of 24 or greater, there will be a

Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of
damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit
points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which
point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may “play
dead” until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and
acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a
troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower
morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces
attackers armed with fire or acid. If a troll loses a limb or
body part, the lost portion regrows in one turn; or, the
creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding
it to the stump.

A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
A troll’s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray,
or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron
gray. They appear sexless if examined, and their method of
reproduction is a mystery. Trolls walk upright but hunched
forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when
they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all
this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.

Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed.
Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much
prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and
claws.

The tyrannosaurus rex is a bipedal carnivorous dinosaur. Despite

from nose to tail. A tyrannosaurus pursues and eats just about
anything it sees. Its tactics are simple – charge in and bite.

Unicorns are horselike creatures having a single
spirally-twisted horn in the middle of the forehead. A typical
adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at
the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly
smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep sea-blue,
violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their
forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like
lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic
weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.

[-- Image: graphics59 --]Three times per day a unicorn can cast
cure light wounds by a touch of its horn. Once per day a
unicorn can transport itself 360' (as the spell dimension
door), and can carry a full load (possibly including a rider)
while doing so. A light load for a unicorn is up to 300 pounds;
a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.

An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they
always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close
enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as
evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and
clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures
for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid
stronger parties.

Alicorns cannot heal or transport themselves by magic as
unicorns do. However, alicorns may become invisible at will,
exactly as if wearing a ring of invisibility.

These creatures appear to be normal Hobgoblins, but Urgoblins
are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to
regenerate much as do Trolls (and have the same limitations).
All Urgoblins are male; if an Urgoblin mates with a female
Hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in
four such offspring will share their father's gifts.

Some Hobgoblin tribes consider Urgoblins an abomination, and
kill them whenever they can be identified. Other Hobgoblin
tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord
them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely
made up of Urgoblins, with kidnapped Hobgoblin females as their
mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to
their mates, so that only those who have the power of
regeneration survive.

Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their
features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look
of wolves. They often embrace finery and decadence and may
assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance,
vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and
throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they
knew in life.

[-- Image: graphics8 --]A vampire can charm anyone who meets its
gaze; a save vs. Spells is allowed to resist, but at a penalty
of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful
that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire.

The bite inflicts 1d3 damage, then each round thereafter one
energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire
regenerates a 1d6 hit points (if needed) for each energy level
drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, he or she
will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than
12 hours later). Vampires spawned in this way are under the
permanent control of the vampire who created them.

If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to
Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For
this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have
great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using
melee weapons, and a vampire will generally choose to use a
melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than
attempting to bite.

Vampires are unharmed by non-magical weapons, and like all
undead are immune to sleep, charm and hold spells. If reduced
to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though
it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8
hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming
normal activity as soon as the first point is restored.

Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per
day can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6
giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such
creatures are nearby). These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and
serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.

A vampire can assume the form of a giant bat or a dire wolf at
will, requiring one round to complete the transformation. The
flying movement listed is for the giant bat form. In animal
form, the vampire can use the normal attacks for that form. It
can't use its other powers while in animal form, except that
creatures summoned are still controlled, and charms already in
effect continue in effect.

For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses:

Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of
garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they
recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These
things don’t harm the vampire – they merely keep it at bay. A
recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a
creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or
make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for
the rest of the encounter.

Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they
can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard
a ship. They are utterly unable to enter a home or other
building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do
so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by
definition open to all.

Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower
incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it, as described
above. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any
vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can act for only
one round and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it
cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water
robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is
destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a
wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the
monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed,
unless the body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described
above, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre.

Giant water termites vary from 1' to 5' in length. They attack
using a noxious spray with a range of 5' which stuns the target
for a full turn on a hit; a save vs. Poison is allowed to avoid
the effect.

However, the primary concern regarding these monsters is the
damage they can do to boats and ships. Each creature can do 2d4
points of damage to a ship's hull per round (no roll required)
for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature's hit
dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat
noisily.

These creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in
swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit
dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in
swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.

Giant weasels resemble their more normally sized cousins, having
long bodies, short legs, and pointed, toothy snouts. They are
predatory animals, hunting those creatures smaller than
themselves.

Weasels of all sorts are cunning, crafty hunters, and surprise
their prey on 1-3 on 1d6. Once a giant weasel bites a living
creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until
the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a
morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of
its victim and flee.

There are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including
several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the
giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only
distinction is that those which are tamed are always called
ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various
humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to
tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.

A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge
flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail. A wyvern’s
body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length
is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about
one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two
legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have
four legs and two wings.

Wyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators
with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a
loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of
a bull alligator.

Wyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more
powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing
at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. Any
living creature hit by the wyvern's stinger must save vs.
Poison or die. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when
making a flyby attack or when landing.

If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry
off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be
carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most
6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make
any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim
makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it
may be dropped. This could mean a fall from a great height.

deathly slow, but they move silently, are very strong and must
be literally hacked to pieces to “kill” them. They take only
half damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point from
arrows, bolts or sling stones (plus any magical bonus). A
zombie never has Initiative and always acts last in any given
round. Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are
immune to sleep, charm and hold magics. As they are mindless,
no form of mind reading is of any use against them. Zombies
never fail morale checks, and thus always fight until
destroyed.
