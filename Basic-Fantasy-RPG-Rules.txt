PART 1: INTRODUCTION

It was our third foray into the dungeons beneath the ancient
fortress in the middle of the river. We were on the second
level down from the ruins, standing before the great bronze
doors beyond which we believed lay the tomb of an ancient
barbarian chieftain. I hadn't believed the tales of the old
drunk at the tavern back at Morgansfort, but for some reason
Apoqulis the Cleric believed him. Turned out his stories were
true… mostly, anyway.

I held a torch for Barthal the Thief as he tried briefly to pick
the lock. He turned around and said, “It must be held by magic.
The lock won't even wiggle.”

Morningstar the Elf smiled. “I have just the thing,” she said,
drawing from her backpack the scroll we took from the goblins.
She unrolled it and began to read, and though I couldn't
understand her words I could see the characters burning away as
she read them, little wisps of smoke as from a candle rising up
from each in turn. Seeing that she was nearly through, I turned
my attention to the lock. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but
the little puff of dust that came from it as she finished didn't
seem like much. She turned to Barthal and said, “Try again.”

I'm tempted to say that Barthal bent to his work, but he's a
Halfling; at just over three feet tall he could look straight
into the lock without stooping a bit. I must have looked
impatient, as Apoqulis leaned over to me and said, “Be still,
Darion, he'll be through in a moment or two.”

Then I heard a loud click, and Barthal turned to me with a
smile. “It's open, my friend. After you!” I handed him the
torch, then stepped to the doors, sword drawn, and Morningstar
joined me, likewise ready. I steeled myself and opened the
doors…

Beyond lay a stone sarcophagus, resting atop a raised platform.
Strewn about the floor were many human skeletons. Apoqulis made
a sign with his hand that I didn't recognize; then we walked in
carefully, trying not to trip over the bones. I noticed among
the bones several bronze swords, covered in verdigris. I
stepped to the sarcophagus. “The lid is likely very heavy,” I
said. “Come, Morningstar, rather than lift it, let's turn it
about so we can see what treasures lie inside.”

[-- Image: graphics2 --]Morningstar called “Wait!” but it was
too late… I had already laid hands upon the sarcophagus. The
bones on the floor began to rattle, then rose up and assembled
themselves in a mockery of life. Without delay they picked up
their swords from the floor and began to attack us. I would
have to wait until later to kick myself, I mused, as I put my
back against the sarcophagus and began to fight the monsters…

What Is This?

The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light game system
based on the d20 SRD v3.5, but heavily rewritten with
inspiration from early role-playing game systems. It is
intended for those who are fans of “old-school” game mechanics.
Basic Fantasy RPG is simple enough for children in perhaps
second or third grade to play, yet still has enough depth for
adults as well.

What Is a Role-Playing Game?

In the more than 30 years since the first role-playing game
appeared, much has changed. Most people have at least heard the
names of one or two such games, and many, many people have
played. Still, there are those who have not tried RPGs; if you
are one of those people, this part is for you.

Role-playing games are played by a number of players, commonly
two to eight, and a Game Master, or GM (often called something
else, but the job remains the same regardless of the title).
Each player generally plays one character, called a player
character or PC, while the Game Master is responsible for
running the world, creating and managing the towns, nations,
ruins, non-player characters (or NPCs), monsters, treasure, and
all other things that aid or challenge the players. Dice are
often used to determine the success or failure of most actions
that take place in the game; Basic Fantasy RPG uses polyhedral
dice, described below, for this purpose.

In effect, role-playing games are just grown-up games of
pretend. If you remember playing pretend as a child, you may
recall having some difficulty deciding whose idea should have
precedence… if one child plays a knight and the other a dragon,
who will win? Surely the knight doesn't win every time.
Role-playing games have rules to determine such things. These
rules can range from the very free-form and simple to the very
complex and detailed.

This game attempts to walk the line between simple and complex,
free-form and detailed. Too much detail and complexity slows
the game down as players and GM spend much time leafing through
the rules and little time actually playing. Free-form games with
simple resolution systems demand more mental agility from the
participants, and are much more dependent on the good judgment
of the Game Master to maintain balance. Basic Fantasy
Role-Playing Game falls between these two extremes, having
rules for the most common activities and guidelines to help the
Game Master judge the unexpected.

What Do I Need to Play?

If you are to be a player, you should have a pencil, some
notebook paper, and a set of dice. Someone in your player group
probably needs to have some graph paper (4 or 5 squares per inch
is best) for drawing maps. You can use preprinted character
sheets (such as those available on the Basic Fantasy RPG
website) if you wish, but notebook paper works fine.

If you are the Game Master, you need all of the above. If this
is your first time as GM, or you have limited preparation time,
you might wish to use a pre-written adventure (called a module)
rather than to create one yourself. Several modules are
distributed on the basicfantasy.org website; the Morgansfort
module, available for free on the website, is specifically
designed for use with a party of new players. Adventure modules
written for other game systems may also be used, but the Game
Master may need to spend some time “converting” such a module
before beginning play.

Using the Dice

[-- Image: graphics4 --]The 20 sided die, or d20, is one of the
most important dice in the game: it is used to resolve attack
rolls and saving throws (concepts that will be explained
later). In general, the die is rolled, modifiers added or
subtracted, and if the total result equals or exceeds a target
number, the roll is a success; otherwise it has failed.

[-- Image: graphics5 --][-- Image: graphics6 --]The 10 sided
die, or d10, is used to generate numbers from 1 to 10; it is
numbered 0 to 9, but a roll of 0 is counted as 10. A pair of
d10's are also used together to generate numbers from 1 to 100,
where a roll of 00 is counted as 100. The two dice should be
different colors, and the player must declare which is the tens
die and which is the ones die before rolling them! (Or, the
player may have a die marked with double digits, as shown.)
Rolling two d10's this way is called a percentile roll, or d%.
These rolls are generally against target numbers, but for the
roll to be a success, the result must be equal to or less than
the target number. So for example, a character using a Thief
ability (described later) with a 30% chance of success rolls
the dice: if the result is 01 to 30, the roll is a success.

[-- Image: graphics7 --][-- Image: graphics8 --]The 4 sided die,
or d4, is a special case. It is not so much rolled as “flipped,”
and the number which is upright is the result of the roll. Note
that d4's are made in two different styles, as shown;
regardless of which style you have, the number rolled is the
one which is upright on all visible sides.

[-- Image: graphics9 --][-- Image: graphics10 --]The other dice
normally used have 6, 8, and 12 sides, and are called d6, d8,
and d12. d6's may be made with either numbers or pips; it makes
no difference which sort you choose.

[-- Image: graphics11 --]When multiple dice are to be rolled and
added together, it's noted in the text like this: 2d6 (roll two
d6 dice and add them together), or 3d4 (roll three d4 dice and
add them together). A modifier may be noted as a “plus” value,
such as 2d8+2 (roll two d8 dice and add them together, then add
2 to the total).

PART 2: PLAYER CHARACTERS

How to Create a Player Character

First, you will need a piece of paper to write down the
character's statistics on. You may use a preprinted character
sheet if one is available, or you may simply use a piece of
notebook paper. An example character is shown below. You should
use a pencil to write down all information, as any statistic may
change during play.

Roll 3d6 for each ability score, as described in the Character
Abilities section, and write the results after the names of the
abilities. Write down the scores in the order you roll them; if
you are unhappy with the scores you have rolled, ask your Game
Master for advice, as he or she may allow some form of point or
score exchanging.

Write down the ability score bonus (or penalty) for each score
beside the score itself, as shown on the table on the next
page.

[-- Image: graphics3 --]Choose a race and class for your
character. Your character must meet the Prime Requisite minimum
for a class, as described in the Character Classes section, in
order to be a member of that class. Also note that there are
minimum (and maximum) ability requirements for the various
races which must be met, as described in the Character Races
section.

Write down the special abilities of your race and class choices,
as described below. If you have chosen to play a Magic-User, ask
your Game Master what spell or spells your character knows; it's
up to the Game Master to decide this, but he or she may allow
you to choose one or more spells yourself.

Note on your character sheet that your character has zero (0)
experience points (or XP); also you may want to note the number
needed to advance to second level, as shown in the table for
your class.

Roll the hit die appropriate for your class, adding your
Constitution bonus or penalty, and note the result as your hit
points on your character sheet. Note that, should your
character have a Constitution penalty, the penalty will not
lower any hit die roll below 1 (so if your Character has a -2
penalty for Constitution, and you roll a 2, the total is
adjusted to 1).

Roll for your starting money. Generally your character will
start with 3d6 times 10 gold pieces, but ask the Game Master
before rolling.

Now, purchase equipment for your character, as shown in the Cost
of Weapons and Equipment section, below. Write your purchases on
your character sheet, and note how much money remains afterward.
Make sure you understand the weapon and armor restrictions for
your class and race before making your purchases.

Since you now know what sort of armor your character is wearing,
you should note your Armor Class on your character sheet. Don't
forget to add your Dexterity bonus or penalty to the figure.

Look up your character's attack bonus (from the table in the
Encounter section) and note it on your character sheet. Don't
add your ability bonuses (or penalties) to this figure, as you
will add a different bonus (Strength or Dexterity) depending on
the sort of weapon you use in combat (i.e. melee or missile
weapon).

Also look up your saving throws (from the tables near the end of
the Encounter section) and note them on your character sheet.
Adjust the saving throw figures based on your race, if your
character is a demi-human (see Character Races, below). Please
note that the saving throw bonuses for demi-humans are
presented as "plus" values, to be added to the die roll; for
convenience, you may simply subtract them from the saving throw
numbers on the character sheet instead.

Finally, if you haven't done so already, name your character.
This often takes longer than all the other steps combined.

Character Abilities

Each character will have a score ranging from 3 to 18 in each of
the following abilities. A bonus or penalty is associated with
each score, as shown on the table below. Each class has a Prime
Requisite ability score, which must be at least 9 in order for
the character to become a member of that class; also, there are
required minimum and maximum scores for each character race
other than Humans, as described under Character Races, below.

Strength: As the name implies, this ability measures the
character's raw physical power. Strength is the Prime Requisite
for Fighters. Apply the ability bonus or penalty for Strength to
all attack and damage rolls in melee (hand to hand) combat. Note
that a penalty here will not reduce damage from a successful
attack below one point in any case (see the Combat section for
details).

Intelligence: This is the ability to learn and apply knowledge.
Intelligence is the Prime Requisite for Magic-Users. The
ability bonus for Intelligence is added to the number of
languages the character is able to learn to read and write; if
the character has an Intelligence penalty, he or she cannot
read more than a word or two, and will only know his or her
native language.

Wisdom: A combination of intuition, willpower and common sense.
Wisdom is the Prime Requisite for Clerics. The Wisdom bonus or
penalty may apply to some saving throws vs. magical attacks,
particularly those affecting the target's will.

Dexterity: This ability measures the character's quickness and
balance as well as aptitude with tools. Dexterity is the Prime
Requisite for Thieves. The Dexterity bonus or penalty is
applied to all attack rolls with missile (ranged) weapons, to
the character's Armor Class value, and to the character's
Initiative die roll.

Constitution: A combination of general health and vitality.
Apply the Constitution bonus or penalty to each hit die rolled
by the character. Note that a penalty here will not reduce any
hit die roll to less than 1 point.

Charisma: This is the ability to influence or even lead people;
those with high Charisma are well-liked, or at least highly
respected. Apply the Charisma bonus or penalty to reaction
rolls. Also, the number of retainers a character may hire, and
the loyalty of those retainers, is affected by Charisma.

Hit Points and Hit Dice

When a character is injured, he or she loses hit points from his
or her current total. Note that this does not change the figure
rolled, but rather reduces the current total; healing will
restore hit points, up to but not exceeding the rolled figure.

When his or her hit point total reaches 0, your character may be
dead. This may not be the end for the character; don't tear up
the character sheet.

First level characters begin play with a single hit die of the
given type, plus the Constitution bonus or penalty, with a
minimum of 1 hit point. Each time a character gains a level,
the player should roll another hit die and add the character's
Constitution bonus or penalty, with the result again being a
minimum of 1 point. Add this amount to the character's maximum
hit points figure. Note that, after 9th level, characters
receive a fixed number of hit points each level, as shown in
the advancement table for the class, and no longer add the
Constitution bonus or penalty.

Languages

All characters begin the game knowing their native language. In
most campaign worlds, Humans all (or nearly all) speak the same
language, often called “Common.” Each demi-human race has its
own language, i.e. Elvish, Dwarvish, or Halfling, and members
of the demi-human races begin play knowing both their own
language and Common (or the local Human language if it isn't
called Common).

Characters with Intelligence of 13 or higher may choose to begin
the game knowing one or more languages other than those given
above; the number of additional languages that may be learned
is equal to the Intelligence bonus (+1, +2, or +3). Characters
may choose to learn other demi-human languages, as well as
humanoid languages such as Orc, Goblin, etc. The GM will decide
which humanoid languages may be learned. The player may choose
to leave one or more bonus language “slots” open, to be filled
during play. Some Game Masters may even allow player characters
to learn exotic languages such as Dragon; also, “dead” or
otherwise archaic languages might be allowed to more scholarly
characters.

Character Races

Dwarves

[-- Image: graphics16 --]Description: Dwarves are a short,
stocky race; both male and female Dwarves stand around four
feet tall and typically weigh around 120 pounds. Their long
hair and thick beards are dark brown, gray or black. They take
great pride in their beards, sometimes braiding or forking
them. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. Dwarves have stout
frames and a strong, muscular build. They are rugged and
resilient, with the capacity to endure great hardships. Dwarves
are typically practical, stubborn and courageous. They can also
be introspective, suspicious and possessive. They have a
lifespan of three to four centuries.

Restrictions: Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters, or Thieves.
They are required to have a minimum Constitution of 9. Due to
their generally dour dispositions, they may not have a Charisma
higher than 17. They may not employ Large weapons more than four
feet in length (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows).

Special Abilities: All Dwarves have Darkvision with a 60' range,
and are able to detect slanting passages, traps, shifting walls
and new construction on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6; a search must be
performed before this roll may be made.

Saving Throws: Dwarves save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison, Magic
Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs. Dragon
Breath.

Elves

[-- Image: graphics21 --]Description: Elves are a slender race,
with both genders standing around five feet tall and weighing
around 130 pounds. Most have dark hair, with little or no body
or facial hair. Their skin is pale, and they have pointed ears
and delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful. They have
keen eyesight and hearing. Elves are typically inquisitive,
passionate, self-assured, and sometimes haughty. Their typical
lifespan is a dozen centuries or more.

Restrictions: Elves may become Clerics, Fighters, Magic-Users or
Thieves; they are also allowed to combine the classes of Fighter
and Magic-User, and of Magic-User and Thief (see Combination
Classes, below). They are required to have a minimum
Intelligence of 9. Due to their generally delicate nature, they
may not have a Constitution higher than 17. Elves never roll
larger than six-sided dice (d6) for hit points.

Special Abilities: All Elves have Darkvision with a 60' range.
They are able to find secret doors more often than normal (1-2
on 1d6 rather than the usual 1 on 1d6). An Elf is so observant
that one has a 1 on 1d6 chance to find a secret door with a
cursory look. Elves are immune to the paralyzing attack of
ghouls. Also, they are less likely to be surprised in combat,
reducing the chance of surprise by 1 in 1d6.

Saving Throws: Elves save at +1 vs. Paralysis or Petrify, and +2
vs. Magic Wands and Spells.

Halflings

Description: Halflings are small, slightly stocky folk who stand
around three feet tall and weigh about 60 pounds. They have
curly brown hair on their heads and feet, but rarely have
facial hair. They are usually fair skinned, often with ruddy
cheeks. Halflings are remarkably rugged for their small size.
They are dexterous and nimble, capable of moving quietly and
remaining very still. They usually go barefoot. Halflings are
typically outgoing, unassuming and good-natured. They live
about a hundred years.

Restrictions: Halflings may become Clerics, Fighters or Thieves.
They are required to have a minimum Dexterity of 9. Due to their
small stature, they may not have a Strength higher than 17.
Halflings never roll larger than six-sided dice (d6) for hit
points regardless of class. Halflings may not use Large
weapons, and must wield Medium weapons with both hands.

Special Abilities: Halflings are unusually accurate with all
sorts of ranged weapons, gaining a +1 attack bonus when
employing them. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than
man-sized, Halflings gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class.
Halflings are quick-witted, thus adding +1 to Initiative die
rolls. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are
able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still
there is only a 10% chance they will be detected. Even indoors,
in dungeons or in non-preferred terrain they are able to hide
such that there is only a 30% chance of detection. Note that a
Halfling Thief will roll only once, using either the Thief
ability or the Halfling ability, whichever is better.

Saving Throws: Halflings save at +4 vs. Death Ray or Poison,
Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and at +3 vs.
Dragon Breath.

Humans

[-- Image: graphics23 --]Description: Humans come in a broad
variety of shapes and sizes; the Game Master must decide what
sorts of Humans live in the game world. An average Human male
in good health stands around six feet tall and weighs about 175
pounds. Most Humans live around 75 years.

Restrictions: Humans may be any single class. They have no
minimum or maximum ability score requirements.

Special Abilities: Humans learn unusually quickly, gaining a
bonus of 10% to all experience points earned.

Saving Throws: Humans are the “standard,” and thus have no
saving throw bonuses.

Combination Classes

To become a member of a combination class, a character must meet
the requirements of both classes. Combination class characters
use the best attack bonus and the best saving throw values of
their original two classes, but must gain experience equal to
the combined requirements of both base classes to advance in
levels. Elves are the only characters eligible to be a member
of one of these combination classes:

Fighter/Magic-User: These characters may both fight and cast
magic spells; further, they are allowed to cast magic spells
while wearing armor. These characters roll six-sided dice (d6)
for hit points.

Magic-User/Thief: Members of this combination class may cast
spells while wearing leather armor, and may use any weapon.
These characters roll four-sided dice (d4) for hit points.

Clerics are those who have devoted themselves to the service of
a deity, pantheon or other belief system. Most Clerics spend
their time in mundane forms of service such as preaching and
ministering in a temple; but there are those who are called to
go abroad from the temple and serve their deity in a more
direct way, smiting undead monsters and aiding in the battle
against evil and chaos. Player character Clerics are assumed to
be among the latter group.

Clerics fight about as well as Thieves, but not as well as
Fighters. They are hardier than Thieves, at least at lower
levels, as they are accustomed to physical labor that the Thief
would deftly avoid. Clerics can cast spells of divine nature
starting at 2nd level, and they have the power to Turn the
Undead, that is, to drive away undead monsters by means of
faith alone (see the Encounter section for details).

The Prime Requisite for Clerics is Wisdom; a character must have
a Wisdom score of 9 or higher to become a Cleric. They may wear
any armor, but may only use blunt weapons (specifically
including warhammer, mace, maul, club, quarterstaff, and
sling).

Fighters include soldiers, guardsmen, barbarian warriors, and
anyone else for whom fighting is a way of life. They train in
combat, and they generally approach problems head on, weapon
drawn.

Not surprisingly, Fighters are best at fighting of all the
classes. They are also the hardiest, able to take more
punishment than any other class. Although they are not skilled
in the ways of magic, Fighters can nonetheless use many magic
items, including but not limited to magical weapons and armor.

[-- Image: Image5 --]The Prime Requisite for Fighters is
Strength; a character must have a Strength score of 9 or higher
to become a Fighter. Members of this class may wear any armor
and use any weapon.

Magic-Users are those who seek and use knowledge of the arcane.
They do magic not as the Cleric does, by faith in a greater
power, but rather through insight and understanding.

Magic-Users are the worst of all the classes at fighting; hours
spent studying massive tomes of magic do not lead a character
to become strong or adept with weapons. They are the least
hardy, equal to Thieves at lower levels but quickly falling
behind.

The Prime Requisite for Magic-Users is Intelligence; a character
must have an Intelligence score of 9 or higher to become a
Magic-User. The only weapons they become proficient with are
the dagger and the walking staff (or cudgel). Magic-Users may
not wear armor of any sort nor use a shield as such things
interfere with spellcasting.

A first level Magic-User begins play knowing read magic and one
other spell of first level. These spells are written in a
spellbook provided by his or her master. The GM may roll for
the spell, assign it as he or she sees fit, or allow the player
to choose it, at his or her option. See the Spells section for
more details.

Thieves are those who take what they want or need by stealth,
disarming traps and picking locks to get to the gold they
crave; or “borrowing” money from pockets, beltpouches, etc.
right under the nose of the “mark” without the victim ever
knowing.

Thieves fight better than Magic-Users but not as well as
Fighters. Avoidance of honest work leads Thieves to be less
hardy than the other classes, though they do pull ahead of the
Magic-Users at higher levels.

The Prime Requisite for Thieves is Dexterity; a character must
have a Dexterity score of 9 or higher to become a Thief. They
may use any weapon, but may not wear metal armor as it
interferes with stealthy activities, nor may they use shields
of any sort. Leather armor is acceptable, however.

Thieves have a number of special abilities, described below. One
Turn must generally be spent to use any of these abilities,
though the GM may amend this as he or she sees fit. The GM may
choose to make any of these rolls on behalf of the player, at
his or her option, to help maintain the proper state of
uncertainty. Also note that the GM may apply situational
adjustments (plus or minus percentage points) as he or she sees
fit; for instance, it's obviously harder to climb a wall slick
with slime than one that is dry, so the GM might apply a
penalty of 20% for the slimy wall.

Open Locks allows the Thief to unlock a lock without a proper
key. It may only be tried once per lock. If the attempt fails,
the Thief must wait until he or she has gained another level of
experience before trying again.

Remove Traps is generally rolled twice: first to detect the
trap, and second to disarm it. The GM will make these rolls as
the player won't know for sure if the character is successful
or not until someone actually tests the trapped (or suspected)
area.

Pick Pockets allows the Thief to lift the wallet, cut the purse,
etc. of a victim without the victim noticing. Obviously, if the
roll is failed, the Thief didn't get what he or she wanted; but
further, the intended victim (or an onlooker, at the GM's
option) will notice the attempt if the die roll is more than
two times the target number (or if the die roll is 00).

Move Silently, like Remove Traps, is always rolled by the GM.
The Thief will usually believe he or she is moving silently
regardless of the die roll, but those he or she is trying to
avoid will hear the Thief if the roll is failed.

Climb Walls permits the Thief to climb sheer surfaces with few
or no visible handholds. This ability should normally be rolled
by the player. If the roll fails, the Thief falls from about
halfway up the wall or other vertical surface. The GM may
require multiple rolls if the distance climbed is more than 100
feet.

Hide permits the Thief to hide in any shadowed area large enough
to contain his or her body. Like Move Silently, the Thief always
believes he or she is being successful, so the GM makes the
roll. A Thief hiding in shadows must remain still for this
ability to work.

Listen is generally used to listen at a door, or to try to
listen for distant sounds in a dungeon. The GM must decide what
noises the Thief might hear; a successful roll means only that a
noise could have been heard. The GM should always make this roll
for the player. Note that the Thief and his or her party must
try to be quiet in order for the Thief to use this ability.

Finally, Thieves can perform a Sneak Attack any time they are
behind an opponent in melee and it is reasonably likely the
opponent doesn't know the Thief is there. The GM may require a
Move Silently or Hide roll to determine this. The Sneak Attack
is made with a +4 attack bonus and does double damage if it is
successful. A Thief usually can't make a Sneak Attack on the
same opponent twice in any given combat.

The Sneak Attack can be performed with any melee (but not
missile) weapon, or may be performed bare-handed (in which case
subduing damage is done; see the Encounter section for details).
Also, the Sneak Attack can be performed with the “flat of the
blade;” the bonuses and penalties cancel out, so the attack has
a +0 attack bonus and does normal damage; the damage done in
this case is subduing damage.

Cost of Weapons and Equipment

Money

Monetary values are usually expressed in gold pieces. In
addition to gold coins, there are coins made of platinum,
silver, electrum (an alloy of gold and silver), and copper.
They are valued as follows:

1 platinum piece (pp)  = 5 gold pieces (gp)

1 gold piece (gp)  = 10 silver pieces (sp)

1 electrum piece (ep)  = 5 silver pieces (sp)

1 silver piece (sp)  = 10 copper pieces (cp)

For game purposes, assume that one gold piece weighs 1/10th of a
pound, and that five coins will “fit” in a cubic inch of storage
space (this isn't literally accurate, but works well enough when
applied to a box or chest).

First level characters generally begin the game with 3d6 x 10 gp
(unless the GM decides otherwise).

Equipment

This list represents common adventuring equipment at average
prices. Prices and availability may vary. Weights are expressed
in pounds. Items marked * weigh very little; ten such items
weigh one pound. Items marked ** have almost no weight and
should not usually be counted.

Weapon Size

Humans and Elves must wield Large weapons with both hands, but
may use Small or Medium weapons in one hand. Halflings may not
use Large weapons at all, and must use Medium weapons with both
hands. Dwarves, due to their stocky, powerful builds, are able
to use Medium weapons one-handed and some Large weapons in two
hands, but Large weapons more than four feet in length are
prohibited (specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows). Some weapons must be used with both hands by design
(such as bows and crossbows) but the maximum size limits still
apply.

The GM should apply similar limitations to weapon-armed
monsters; for instance, kobolds and goblins are similar in size
to Halflings, and thus should have similar weapon limits.

Missile weapon ranges are given in feet. In the wilderness,
substitute yards for feet. If the target is as close as or
closer than the Short range figure, the attacker receives a +1
attack bonus. If the target is further away than the Medium
range figure, but not beyond the Long range figure, the
attacker receives a -2 attack penalty.

Explanation of Equipment

A Backpack will hold a maximum 40 pounds or 3 cubic feet of
goods. Some items may be lashed to the outside, and thus count
toward the weight limit but not the volume limit. A Halfling's
backpack holds at most 30 pounds and/or 1½ cubic feet, but
costs the same as a full-sized item.

A Candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with dim light
extending 5' further. A normal candle will burn about 3 turns
per inch of height.

Chalk is useful for “blazing a trail” through a dungeon or ruin.

Holy Water is explained in the Encounter section.

Iron Spikes are useful for spiking doors closed (or spiking them
open) and may be used as crude pitons in appropriate situations.

A Lantern will provide light covering a 30' radius; dim light
will extend about 20' further. A lantern will consume a flask
of oil in 18+1d6 turns. A Hooded Lantern allows the light to be
hidden or revealed as the user pleases; in all other ways it
performs as an ordinary lantern. A Bullseye Lantern projects a
cone of light 30' long and 30' wide at the widest point, with
dim light extending an additional 20' beyond that point. This
type of lantern is generally hooded.

A Map or Scroll Case is a tubular oiled leather case used to
carry maps, scrolls, or other paper items. The case will have a
water-resistant (but not waterproof) cap which slides over the
end, and a loop to allow the case to be hung from a belt or
bandolier. A standard scroll case can hold up to 10 sheets of
paper, or a single scroll of up to seven spells.

A Mirror is useful in a dungeon environment for many reasons;
for instance, it is the only way to look at a Medusa without
being turned to stone. Mirrors are also useful for looking
around corners, and can be used outdoors to send signals using
reflected sunlight.

A Quiver is an open container used to hold arrows. A Bolt Case
is a similar sort of container for crossbow bolts. In either
case, the standard capacity is 20 missiles. The length of a
quiver or bolt case must match the length of the ammunition for
it to be useful; therefore, there are longbow and shortbow
quivers and light and heavy crossbow bolt cases. The price is
the same for all types.

Dry Rations may consist of dry bread, hard cheese, dried fruit,
nuts, beans, jerky, or any other food which will not “go bad”
in less than about a month (if not longer). Dry rations are
generally sold in quantities sufficient for one character for a
week, and are packaged in waxed or oiled cloth to protect them.

Hemp Rope is ½ inch in diameter and has a breaking strength of
1,600 pounds. Safe working load for a rope is normally
one-quarter of the breaking strength. One or more knots in a
rope cut the breaking strength in half. This does not affect
the safe working load, because knots are figured into the
listed one-quarter ratio.

Silk Rope is about 3/8 inch in diameter and has a breaking
strength of 1,600 pounds, although it weighs considerably less
than hemp rope. The notes regarding rope strength given for
hemp rope, above, apply here also.

A Large Sack will hold at most 40 pounds or 4 cubic feet of
goods.

A Small Sack will hold at most 20 pounds or 2 cubic feet of
goods.

A pair of Saddlebags will hold at most 10 pounds or 1 cubic foot
of goods (divided evenly between both bags).

Thieves' Picks and Tools are required for the use of Thief
abilities such as opening locks and removing traps. These
abilities may not be usable without appropriate tools, or may
be used at a penalty at the option of the Game Master.

A Tinderbox is generally purchased with a flint and steel; the
flint, a piece of hard rock, is struck vigorously against a
C-shaped piece of high-carbon steel. When done correctly, hot
sparks will fly from the flint and steel into the tinder,
hopefully starting a fire. The best tinder is a dried piece of
prepared tinder fungus, carried in the tinderbox to keep it
dry; char cloth, hemp rope, or even very dry grass can
substitute if prepared tinder fungus is not available. The time
required to start a fire should be determined by the GM
according to the prevailing conditions; under ideal conditions,
starting a fire with a flint, steel and tinder takes about a
turn.

A Torch sheds light over a 30' radius, with dim light extending
about 20' further, and burns for 1d4+4 turns. Of course, a
torch is also useful for setting flammable materials (such as
cobwebs or oil) alight.

A Whetstone is used to sharpen and maintain edged weapons such
as swords, daggers, and axes.

Wineskin/Waterskin is a container for drinking water or wine;
though generally water is taken into a dungeon or wilderness
environment. The standard waterskin holds one quart of liquid,
which is the minimum amount required by a normal character in a
single day. If adventuring in the desert or other hot, dry
areas, a character may need as much as ten times this amount.
Note that the given 2 pound weight is for a full skin; an empty
skin has negligible weight.

Vehicles

The following tables give details of various land and sea
vehicles. Game Masters should feel free to create their own
vehicles, in which case the table can be used for guidance.

Notes Regarding Vehicles

The Crew figure given reflects the minimum number of sailors
and/or rowers needed to operate the ship. Officers are not
counted among these numbers, and of course it is always a good
idea to hire extra sailors and/or rowers to ensure that any
casualties will not slow down the ship.

Cargo for wagons is given in pounds, while for ships it is given
in tons. If the ship sails night and day, each passenger
requires living space equivalent to one ton of cargo; in
addition, provisions for one man for one month occupy 1/10 of a
ton of space.

Movement is given separately here in feet (yards, actually; see
Time and Scale in Part 4: The Adventure for an explanation) as
well as miles per day. The encounter movement of ships is not
directly related to the long-distance travel rate, since the
crew must work hard to make the ship move quickly in combat,
and this level of effort cannot be maintained day and night.

The parenthesized figure represents maneuverability; see
Maneuverability in Part 5: The Encounter for details.

See Attacking a Vehicle, also in the Encounter section, for
details on the Hardness and HP statistics.

A chariot requires a single horse, generally a warhorse, to pull
it. Both coaches and wagons require at least a pair of draft
horses to pull them.

A caravel is a highly maneuverable sailing ship with two or
three masts. Though superficially similar to the larger
carrack, caravels are capable of sailing up rivers, a task for
which the larger ship is ill suited.

A carrack is a large, ocean-going sailing ship with three or
four masts.

Galleys are equipped with both sails and oars; the second listed
movement rate for galleys is the rowing speed. A small galley
will have around 20 rows of oars, with each oar pulled by two
men (for a total of 80 rowers) while a large galley will have
around 35 rows of oars (for a total of 140 rowers). Galleys are
generally much more maneuverable than sailing ships such as the
carrack or caravel, and may be outfitted with rams.

The longship commonly used by northern raiders is very similar
to the large galley. However, where more civilized nations have
specialist rowers, sailors, and marines, the crew of a longship
is more generalized; most crewmen will be qualified for all of
these tasks.

Siege Engines

These are weapons used to attack strongholds, or sometimes
ships. Their cost may be up to twice as high in a remote
location. A siege engine that throws missiles (a ballista,
onager or trebuchet) must have a trained artillerist to fire
it; this is the character who makes the attack rolls for the
weapon. Missile-throwing engines have attack penalties,
detailed below. Note: siege engines are not generally usable
against individuals or monsters; the GM may make exceptions for
very large monsters like giants or dragons.

Ballista: This is effectively a very large crossbow that may
fire a spear-like bolt or a large stone. It is usually mounted
on a tripod or wagon, but may also be mounted on a ship. When
firing bolts, a ballista cannot damage brick or stone. A
ballista requires a crew of three to operate.

Battering Ram: These are usually operated under a sow (a sort of
portable roof). They require a crew of eight or more.

Onager: This weapon throws a stone with a fairly flat
trajectory. An onager requires a crew of four to operate.

[-- Image: graphics19 --]Trebuchet: This mighty weapon uses a
counterweight to fling a stone on a high, arcing path. It
cannot fire at targets within 200 yards. If it is aimed at a
target that is more than 20’ higher than the weapon, there is
an additional –2 attack penalty. A trebuchet requires a crew of
eight to operate.

PART 3: SPELLS

The number of spells of each level which a Cleric or Magic-User
may cast per day is shown on the appropriate table in the
Characters section, above. Each day, usually in the morning,
spellcasters prepare spells to replace those they have used.
Clerics do this through prayer, while Magic-Users must study
their spellbooks. Spells prepared but not used persist from day
to day; only those actually cast must be replaced. A spellcaster
may always choose to dismiss a prepared spell (without casting
it) in order to prepare a different spell of that level.

Spellcasters must have at least one hand free, and be able to
speak, in order to cast spells; thus, binding and gagging a
spellcaster is an effective means of preventing him or her from
casting spells. In combat, casting a spell usually takes the
same time as making an attack. If a spellcaster is attacked
(even if not hit) or must make a saving throw (whether
successful or not) on the Initiative number on which he or she
is casting a spell, the spell is spoiled and lost. As a
specific exception, two spell casters releasing their spells at
each other on the same Initiative number will both succeed in
their casting; one caster may disrupt another with a spell only
if he or she has a better Initiative, and chooses to delay
casting the spell until right before the other caster.

Some spells are reversible; such spells are shown with an
asterisk after the name.

Cleric Spells

Clerics receive their spells through faith and prayer. Each day,
generally in the morning, a Cleric must pray for at least three
turns in order to prepare spells. Of course, the Cleric may be
expected to pray more than this in order to remain in his or
her deity's good graces.

Because they gain their spells through prayer, a Cleric may
prepare any spell of any level he or she is able to cast.
However, in some cases the Cleric's deity may limit the
availability of certain spells; for instance, a deity devoted
to healing may refuse to grant reversed healing spells.

Magic-User Spells

Magic-Users cast spells through the exercise of knowledge and
will. They prepare spells by study of their spellbooks; each
Magic-User has his or her own spellbook containing the magical
formulae for each spell the Magic-User has learned. Spellbooks
are written in a magical script that can only be read by the
one who wrote it, or through the use of the spell read magic.
All Magic-Users begin play knowing read magic, and it is so
ingrained that it can be prepared without a spellbook.

A Magic-User may only prepare spells after resting (i.e. a good
night's sleep), and needs one turn per each three spell levels
to do so (rounding fractions up). Spells prepared but not used
on a previous day are not lost. For example, a 3rd level
Magic-User preparing all three of his or her available spells
(two 1st level and one 2nd level) is preparing a total of 4
levels of spells, and thus needs 2 turns (4 divided by 3 and
rounded up).

Rules for the acquisition of new spells are found in the Game
Master's section on page 162.

All Spells, in Alphabetical Order

Animate Dead  Range:  touch

Cleric 4, Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into
undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken
commands. They remain animated until they are destroyed. The
caster may animate a number of hit dice of undead equal to
twice his or her caster level, and no more. Animated skeletons
have hit dice equal to the number the creature had in life; for
skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one hit die,
regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have
one more hit die than the creature had in life. An animated
skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a
zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The
caster must touch the remains to be animated. No character may
normally control more hit dice of undead than 4 times his or
her level, regardless of how many times this spell is cast.

Animate Objects  Range:  100'+10'/level

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell imbues inanimate objects with mobility and a
semblance of life. The animated objects then attack whomever or
whatever the caster designates. This spell cannot animate
objects carried or worn by a creature. An animated object can
be of any non-magical material. The caster can animate one
object per level, up to a maximum of 25 lbs. per caster level
(i.e. 300 lbs. at 12th level, 325 lbs. at 13th level, and so
on).

The GM must rule on the effectiveness of animated objects in
combat. In general, animated objects attack using the same
attack bonus as the caster. Small or lightweight objects do no
more than 1d4 damage per hit, while larger and/or heavier
objects do 1d6 or 1d8 (at the GM's discretion). As a special
case, weapons which are animated do damage using the normal die
roll for the type, but only up to a maximum 1d8. Animated
objects have a movement rate of 10', and generally must move in
contact with the ground (walking, hopping, slithering, or
bouncing, however seems most appropriate to the GM).

Anti-Magic Shell  Range:  10' radius

Magic-User 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

Within a 10' radius around the caster, all magic is negated for
the full duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect
the caster, magic items and spells within the radius are
suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further magic until
the spell has expired.

Blade Barrier  Range:  90'

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell creates a wall of whirling blades up to 20' long per
caster level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius
of up to 5' per two levels. Either form will be up to 20 ft.
high (as allowed by available space). Any creature passing
through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level
(maximum 15d6), with a save vs. Death Ray reducing damage to
half.

If the caster evokes the barrier so that it appears where
creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through
the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on
the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a
successful save vs. Death Ray.

A blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) against
attacks made through it.

Bless*  Range:  50' radius

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 minute/level

This spell gives the caster and his or her allies (within a 50'
radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 on attack rolls, morale
checks (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and
saving throws against magical fear.

The reverse of bless is called bane. It fills the caster's
enemies (within a 50' radius) with fear and doubt, causing each
affected creature to suffer a –1 penalty on attack rolls, morale
checks, and saving throws against magical fear.

Charm Animal  Range:  60'

Cleric 2  Duration:  level+1d4 rounds

This spell allows the caster to charm one or more animals, in
much the same fashion as charm person, at a rate of 1 hit die
per caster level. The caster may decide which individual
animals out of a mixed group are to be affected first; excess
hit dice of effect are ignored. No saving throw is allowed,
either for normal or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more
fantastic nature (as determined by the GM) are allowed a save
vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the animals
will resume normal activity immediately.

This spell does not grant the caster any special means of
communication with the affected animals; if combined with speak
with animals, this spell becomes significantly more useful.

Charm Monster  Range:  30'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  special

This spell functions like charm person, except that the effect
is not restricted by creature type or size. Undead monsters are
unaffected. This spell can affect 3d6 hit dice of creatures of 3
or fewer hit dice, or one creature of more than 3 hit dice.
Saving throws are made just as for charm person.

Charm Person  Range:  30'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell makes a humanoid creature of 4 hit dice or less
regard the caster as its trusted friend and ally. Humans and
demi-humans may be affected, regardless of level of ability. A
save vs. Spells will negate the effect. If the creature is
currently being threatened or attacked by the caster or his or
her allies, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The
spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person
as if it were an automaton; rather, it perceives his or her
words and actions in the most favorable way. The caster can try
to give the subject orders, but it will not do anything it
wouldn’t ordinarily do, and further may receive an additional
saving throw to overcome the magic (at the GM's discretion).
The caster must speak the target's language to communicate any
commands, or else be good at pantomiming; of course, if the
caster is attacked, the charmed creature will act to protect
its “friend” (though that could mean attacking the caster's
enemies, or attempting to carry off the caster to a “safe”
place). The target receives a new saving throw each day if it
has an Intelligence of 13 or greater, every week if its
Intelligence is 9-12, or every month if its Intelligence is 8
or less.

Clairvoyance  Range:  60'

Magic-User 3  Duration:  12 turns

This spell enables the caster to see into another area through
the eyes of a living creature in that area. The caster must
specify the direction and approximate distance, up to a maximum
of 60' away. If there is no appropriate creature in that area,
the spell fails. No saving throw is allowed, and the target
creature is unaware that it is being so used. The caster may
choose another subject creature after at least a turn has
passed, enabling multiple locations to be viewed. If the
subject creature moves out of range, contact is lost, though
the caster may be able to choose another target in this case.

Cloudkill  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 5  Duration:   6 rounds/level

This spell creates a 20'x20'x20' cloud of poison gas which moves
at a rate of 10' per round under the control of the caster (so
long as he or she concentrates on it). The gas kills outright
any creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice or levels it comes in
contact with; creatures having 4 or more hit dice or levels
must save vs. Poison or die. The cloud persists for the entire
duration even if the caster ceases to concentrate upon it.

Commune  Range:  self

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell puts the caster in contact with his patron deity or
an extraplanar servant thereof, who answers one yes-or-no
question per caster level. The ritual to cast this spell takes
1 turn to complete. The being contacted may or may not be
omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied
with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or
completely. These details are left to the GM's discretion.

Confusion  Range:  360'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  2 rounds+1/level

This spell causes up to 3d6 living creatures within a 30' radius
circle around the target point to become confused, making them
unable to independently determine what they will do. A saving
throw vs. Spells is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the
following table on each subject’s Initiative number each round
to see what the subject does.

d20

Behavior

1–2

Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster
if attack is not possible).

3–4

Act normally.

5–10

Do nothing but babble incoherently.

11–14

Flee away from caster at top possible speed.

15–20

Attack nearest creature.

A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action
does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any
special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any
confused character who is attacked automatically retaliates on
its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn
comes.

Conjure Elemental  Range:  240'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

A portal to one of the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or
Water is opened, allowing the Magic-User to summon an elemental
from that plane. At most one elemental of each type may be
summoned by the caster in a given day. Once the elemental
appears, it serves the conjurer indefinitely, provided the
caster concentrates on nothing but controlling the creature;
spell casting, combat, or movement over half the normal rate
results in loss of concentration. The conjurer, while in
control of an elemental, can dismiss it to its native plane at
will (doing so on his or her Initiative if in combat). If the
Magic-User loses concentration, control of the summoned
Elemental is lost and cannot be regained. The creature then
seeks to attack the conjurer and all others in its path. Only
dispel magic or dispel evil will banish the elemental once
control has been lost. An elemental may, of course, choose to
return to its home plane on its own; such creatures will not
choose to remain on the material plane for long.

Continual Light*  Range:  360'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 year/level

This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as
full daylight up to a 30' radius, with light of lesser
intensity to a radius of 60'. Continual light can be cast on an
object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the light
spell, up to a maximum range of 360' from the caster. The spell
remains in effect for one year per level of the caster.

As with light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if
cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are
allowed a save vs. Death Ray; if the save is made, the spell is
cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of
-4 is applied to the blinded creature's attack rolls if the
saving throw fails.

The reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence
of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light
sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind in the same
way as continual light.

Create Food  Range:  10'

Cleric 5  Duration:  permanent

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of the caster's
choice, highly nourishing, but rather bland. Up to 3 men or one
horse per caster level can be fed for one day with this spell.
Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours,
although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting
purify food and water on it.

Create Water  Range:  10'

Cleric 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell creates one gallon of water per caster level. Note
that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available
at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just
like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per
gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.

Cure Blindness  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  instantaneous

With this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering
blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including
light or continual light). Blindness caused by a curse cannot
be cured by this spell.

Cure Disease*  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  instantaneous

Cure disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering
from. The spell also kills parasites afflicting the target
creature. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this
spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or
higher.

Note: This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new
exposure to the same disease.

Cure Light Wounds*

Cleric 1  Range:  touch

Duration:  instantaneous

With this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 hit points of damage by
laying his or her hand upon the injured creature.

The reverse form of this spell, cause light wounds, causes 1d6+1
damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack roll
is required in this case.

Undead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite
fashion; they are injured by cure light wounds and healed by
cause light wounds.

Cure Serious Wounds*

Cleric 4  Range:  touch

Duration:  instantaneous

This spell works exactly like cure light wounds, save that it
heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The
reverse, cause serious wounds, also works exactly like cause
light wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in
damage.

Darkvision  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 hour/level

The subject receives Darkvision with a range of 60' for the
duration of the spell. (See page 37 for details.)

Death Spell  Range:  240'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell will kill 3d12 hit dice or levels of creatures in a
30' radius sphere centered wherever the caster wishes (within
the range limit). Excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Each
creature affected is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; those that
fail the save die immediately. Creatures of 8 or more hit dice
or levels are immune to the spell, as are undead monsters,
golems, and any other “creature” that is not truly alive.

Detect Evil*  Range:  60'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the
caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items
with evil enchantments, and possibly extraplanar creatures of
evil nature. Normal characters, even “bad” characters, cannot
be detected by this spell, as only overwhelming evil is
detectable. The caster sees the “evil” creatures or objects
with a definite glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen
by anyone else.

The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide. Note
that items such as ordinary traps or poisons are not “evil,”
and thus not detectable by this spell.

Reversed, this spell becomes detect good, which works just as
described above with respect to detecting “good” enchantments,
angelic creatures, and so on.

Detect Invisible  Range:  60'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

By means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible
characters, creatures or objects within the given range, seeing
them as translucent shapes.

Detect Magic  Range:  60'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  2 turns

The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or
enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight,
seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing light. Only the caster
sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected
by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic
will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the
caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack
penalty of only -2.

Dimension Door  Range:  10'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  instantaneous

The caster of this spell instantly transfers himself or herself,
or any single target creature within range, to any spot within
200' plus 20' per caster level. The caster or target creature
always arrives at exactly the spot desired, whether the caster
visualizes the area or states direction and distance. An
unwilling target may save vs. Spells to avoid being
transported. Anything worn or carried by the caster or target
creature will be transported also, including another character
or creature if the transportee can lift it. If the target area
is within a solid object, the spell fails automatically.

Disintegrate  Range:  60'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell causes a thin, green ray to spring from the caster's
pointing finger. Any single creature or object (up to a
10x10x10 foot cube of material) is entirely disintegrated,
leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated
creature’s equipment is unaffected.

A creature that makes a successful save vs. Spells is
unaffected. The ray can target only one creature per casting,
if that target saves, the spell is wasted.

Dispel Evil  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This powerful spell aids the caster in dealing with creatures
from the nether planes, hereafter called “evil creatures.”

First, the caster gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against
attacks by evil creatures.

Second, the caster can choose to drive an evil creature back to
its home plane by touch (requiring a successful attack roll).
The creature can negate the effects with a successful save vs.
Spells. This use discharges and ends the spell, even if the
saving throw succeeds.

Third, with a touch the caster can automatically dispel any one
spell cast by an evil creature. Exception: Spells that can’t be
dispelled by dispel magic also can’t be dispelled by dispel
evil. Saving throws do not apply to this effect. This use also
ends the spell.

The exact definition of evil is left for the GM to decide;
however, extraplanar creatures that oppose the caster should
almost always qualify.

Dispel Magic  Range:  120'

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have
been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or
at least their effects) within a cubic area 20' on a side. The
caster must choose whether to dispel magic on a creature or
object, or to affect an area.

If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spell effects
(including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast
upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled.
Any spell or effect having a caster level equal to or less than
the dispel magic caster's level is ended automatically. Those
created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is
a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell
effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level
caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a
20% chance of failure.

Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically
includes any curse, including those created by bestow curse
(the reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.

ESP  Range:  60'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell permits the caster to detect the surface thoughts of
one or more targets within range. The caster must designate a
direction, and then concentrate for a turn in order to “hear”
the thoughts. Each turn the caster may choose to “listen” in a
different direction. The caster may stop listening, then resume
again later, so long as the duration has not expired. The target
creature is not normally aware of being spied upon in this way.

Rock more than 2 inches thick or a thin coating of lead or gold
will block the spell. All undead creatures are immune to this
effect, as are mindless creatures such as golems.

Feeblemind  Range:  180'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  permanent

If the target creature fails a saving throw vs. Spells, its
Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected
creature is unable to cast spells, understand language, or
communicate coherently. The victim does remember who its
friends are and can follow and protect them from harm. The
subject remains in this state until a heal spell is used to
cancel the effect. A target creature that can cast Magic-User
spells suffers a penalty of -4 on its saving throw against this
spell.

Find Traps  Range:  30'

Cleric 2  Duration:  3 turns

This spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both
mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30’ of a
trap, he or she will see it glow with a faint greenish-blue
aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain
natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls
of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with
the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about
its type or nature.

Find the Path  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a specified destination. The caster must have
some knowledge about the location; any location the caster has
ever visited can be so located, as well as locations described
to the caster. Even knowing the name of a location (if it has a
name) is enough for this spell to function.

The locale can be outdoors or underground. Find the path works
with respect to locations, not objects or creatures. The
location must be on the same plane as the caster at the time of
casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction
that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at
appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions
to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to detect
secret doors and to know any passwords required. The spell ends
when the destination is reached or the duration expires,
whichever comes first.

Fireball  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

A fireball spell creates an explosion of flame that detonates
with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster
level to every creature within a spherical volume having a 20'
radius. A save vs. Spells for half damage is allowed. The
explosion creates almost no pressure.

The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance
and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing,
pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it
impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to
attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at
that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.)
If the caster attempts to send the bead through a narrow
passage, such as through an arrow slit, he or she must roll a
missile attack (without range adjustments) to hit the opening,
or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as
lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to
an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
fireball may continue beyond the barrier in order to attain its
full volume.

Flesh to Stone*  Range:  30'/level

Magic-User 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes the subject, along with all its carried gear,
to turn into a mindless, inert statue. A saving throw vs.
Petrification is allowed to resist the spell. If the statue
resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if
ever returned to its original state) suffers equivalent damage
or deformities. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by
this spell.

The reverse spell, stone to flesh, acts as a counterspell for
flesh to stone, restoring the creature just as it was when it
was petrified. It does nothing if applied to stone that is not
the result of flesh to stone or similar petrification effects
(such as a medusa's gaze).

Floating Disc  Range:  0

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 turns +1/level

This spell creates an invisible, slightly concave circular plane
of force for carrying loads. It is about the size of a shield,
being 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can
hold a maximum of 500 pounds of weight. (Note that water weighs
about 8 pounds per gallon.) The disc must be loaded so that the
items placed upon it are properly supported, or they will (of
course) fall off. For example, the disc can support just over
62 gallons of water, but the water must be in a barrel or other
reasonable container that can be placed upon the disc.
Similarly, a pile of loose coins will tend to slip and slide
about, and some will fall off with every step the caster takes;
but a large sack full of coins, properly tied, will remain
stable.

The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the
caster's waist. It remains still when within 10' of the caster,
and follows at the caster's movement rate if he or she moves
away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to
position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than
10' from the caster. When the spell duration expires, the disc
disappears from existence and drops whatever was supported to
the surface beneath.

Fly  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 turn/level

The subject of this spell can fly at a speed equal to his or her
normal ground movement rate (as adjusted by encumbrance). The
subject can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed,
with the same maneuverability as the subject has when moving on
the ground. Flying under the effect of this spell requires only
as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or
cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can neither
charge nor run, nor carry aloft more weight than his or her
maximum load.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still
aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 120'
per round for 1d10 rounds. If the subject reaches the ground in
that amount of time, he or she lands safely. If not, the
subject falls the rest of the distance, taking normal falling
damage. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the
subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is
dispelled.

Geas*  Range:  5' per level

Magic-User 6  Duration:  special

Geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some
service or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to
understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a
geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts
that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to
resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may
choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with
the caster to perform some service.

The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the
geas is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the
spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster
level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions, at the
GM's discretion.

For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas
(or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a –2 penalty to
each of its ability scores, up to a total of –8. No ability
score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability
score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes
obeying the geas.

A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse
spell, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel
magic does not affect a geas.

Growth of Animals

Cleric 3  Range:  60'+10'/level

Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and
eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will do
double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its
existing natural Armor Class increases by 2. The animal's
carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save
vs. Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals
will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused
or panicky afterward (at the GM's discretion).

All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged
by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical
properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves
the enlarged creature’s possession instantly returns to its
normal size.

The spell gives no means of command or influence over the
enlarged animals.

Growth of Plants*  Range:  120'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes,
creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within range to become
thick and overgrown. The dimensions of the growth are
determined by the caster, but cannot exceed 1000 sq. feet (a
10'x100' area or equivalent) per 5 caster levels. The plants
entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or
force a way through. All movement within the affected area is
reduced to no more than 5’ per round for less than giant sized
creatures; giant sized creatures are reduced to half normal
movement rate. The area must have brush and/or trees in it for
this spell to take effect.

The reverse form, shrink plants, may be used to render overgrown
areas passable. The area of effect is identical to the normal
version.

Growth of plants and its reverse are permanent until countered,
either by the opposite form or by dispel magic. This spell has
no effect on animated plant creatures of any sort.

Hallucinatory Terrain

Magic-User 4  Range:  400'+40'/level

Duration:  12 turns/level

This spell makes one 10 yard cube per level of outdoor terrain
appear like a different type (i.e. field into forest, grassland
into desert, or the like). This spell requires a full turn to
cast.

The affected terrain looks, sounds, and smells like another sort
of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within
the area are not hidden or changed in appearance. A save vs.
Spells is allowed to see through the illusion, but only if the
creatures or characters affected actively attempt to do so.

Haste*  Range:  30'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell accelerates the actions of 1 creature per caster
level. The affected creatures move and act twice as quickly as
normal, having double their normal movement rates and making
twice the normal attacks per round, for the duration of the
spell. Spellcasting is not accelerated, nor is the use of magic
items such as wands, which may still be used just once per
round. Multiple haste or speed effects don’t combine; only
apply the most powerful or longest lasting effect.

Reversed, haste becomes slow; affected creatures move at half
speed, attacking half as often (generally, every other round)
and making half a normal move each round. Naturally, target
creatures may save vs. Spells to avoid the effect. Haste and
slow counter and dispel each other.

Heal*  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

Heal enables the caster to wipe away injury and afflictions. It
immediately ends any and all of the following adverse
conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blindness,
confusion, deafness, disease, exhaustion or fatigue,
feeblemind, insanity, nausea, and poison. It also restores all
but 1d4 of the target's hit points. Heal does not remove
negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score
points.

The reversed spell, harm, injures the creature touched so
horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The caster
must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case; failure
means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the victim has fewer
hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will
take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in
which harm may kill a creature).

Generally, both heal and harm only affect living creatures. If
used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm;
likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as
golems are unaffected by either spell.

Hold Monster  Range:  180'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  2d8 turns

This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects
any living creature that fails its save vs. Spells.

Hold Person  Range:  180'

Cleric 2, Magic-User 3  Duration:  2d8 turns

This spell will render any living (not undead) human, demi-human
or humanoid creature paralyzed. Creatures larger than ogres will
not be affected by this spell. Targets of the spell are aware,
and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including
speech. A successful save vs. Spells will negate the effect.
The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her
save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures
in the group may be affected.

A winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and
falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can’t
swim and may drown.

Hold Portal  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter
of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as
if it were securely closed and normally locked. A knock spell
or a successful dispel magic spell can negate a hold portal
spell.

Ice Storm  Range:  300'+30'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 round

This spell causes great magical hailstones to pound down for 1
full round, dealing 5d6 points of damage to every creature in a
20' radius around the target spot; a successful save vs. Spells
will reduce damage by half. The ice storm fills a vertical
volume of 40', so creatures higher than that distance above the
target spot are unaffected. A –20% penalty applies to each
Listen roll made within the ice storm’s effect, and all land
movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the
duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other
than the damage dealt). Any creature naturally resistant to
cold takes half damage (or one-quarter damage if it makes its
save).

Insect Plague  Range:  300'+30'/level

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell summons one swarm of locusts per three caster levels,
to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level. See Insect Swarm in
the Monsters section for the effects of a swarm. The swarms
must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one
other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous
area). The caster may summon the locust swarms so that they
share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any
creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after
being summoned.

Invisibility  Range:  touch

Magic-User 2  Duration:  special

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from
sight, including Darkvision. If the recipient is a creature
carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If the spell is cast on
someone else, neither the caster nor his or her allies can see
the subject, unless they can normally see invisible things or
employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become
visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing
or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes
invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the
effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of
an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10
feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not
magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the
recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts any
spell. Actions (other than spellcasting) directed at unattended
objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not
an attack. The spell lasts at most 24 hours.

Invisibility 10' Radius

Magic-User 3  Range:  touch

Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell functions like invisibility, except that this spell
confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the
recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the
recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves
as if unaffected by the spell. Affected creatures (other than
the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for
themselves, but if the spell recipient attacks, the
invisibility ends for all affected creatures. Any affected
creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures
moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become
invisible (including any previously affected creatures who have
become visible as described above).

Invisible Stalker  Range:  0

Magic-User 6  Duration:  special

The caster summons an invisible stalker to do his or her bidding
(see the Monsters section, below, for details). The spell
persists until dispel evil is cast on the creature, it is
slain, or the task is fulfilled. The GM is advised to review
the monster entry for the invisible stalker when this spell is
used, as they may not always be reliable servants.

Knock  Range:  30'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  special

The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or wizard
locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or
trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles,
or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can
be opened). If used to open a wizard locked door, the spell
does not remove the wizard lock but simply suspends its
functioning for one turn. In all other cases, the door does not
relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not
raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor
will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can undo
a single means of preventing access.

Levitate  Range:  touch

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

Levitate allows the caster to move himself or herself, another
creature, or an object up and down as desired. A creature must
be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or
possessed by a willing creature. The caster can mentally direct
the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round,
by concentration. The caster cannot move the recipient
horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of
a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move
laterally (generally at half its normal land speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a weapon finds itself
increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 attack
penalty, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5.
A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin
again at –1.

Light*  Range:  120'

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Duration:  6 turns + 1/level

This spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates
a 30' radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20')
around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if
cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object.
Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.

Reversed, light becomes darkness, creating an area of darkness
just as described above. This darkness blocks out Darkvision
and negates mundane light sources.

A light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness
spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing
so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing
ambient light level.

Either version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by
means of casting it on the target's ocular organs. The target is
allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray to avoid the effect, and if
the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A light
or darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of
effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the
victim).

Lightning Bolt  Range:  50'+10'/level

Magic-User 3  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that
deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level to each
creature within its area. A save vs. Spells for half damage is
allowed. The bolt begins at the caster's fingertips and extends
to the range given. The caster may choose to limit the range of
the spell, but the minimum range is 60 feet. The lightning bolt
passes through an area 5' wide, arcing and jumping, so that,
while it is not actually 5' wide, for game purposes treat it as
if it is so.

The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects
in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such
as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused
to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range
permits; otherwise, it may reflect from the barrier back toward
the caster, or in a random direction at the GM's option.
Creatures already affected by the lightning bolt do not take
additional damage if struck by the reflection of the same bolt.

Locate Object  Range:  360'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a
well-known or clearly visualized object. He or she can search
for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is
located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot
specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that
particular item firsthand (not merely through divination such
as clairvoyance or a crystal ball). The spell is blocked by
even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by
this spell.

Lower Water  Range:  360'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by
as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1
inch). The water is lowered within a more or less square-shaped
depression whose sides are up to 10 feet long per caster level.
In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep
ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and
similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them
unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the
spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based
creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (the reverse of
haste); a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success negating the
effect. The spell has no effect on other creatures.

Magic Jar  Range:  60'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  special

By casting magic jar, the caster places his or her soul in a gem
or large crystal within spell range (known as the magic jar),
leaving the body lifeless. The caster may then attempt to take
control of a nearby living creature within spell range, forcing
its soul into the magic jar. The caster may move back to the jar
(thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to
possess another body. The spell ends when the caster's soul
returns to his or her own body, leaving the receptacle empty.

To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and
the caster must know where it is, though he or she does not
need to be able to see it. When the caster transfers his or her
soul upon casting, the caster's body is, as near as anyone can
tell, dead, but does not undergo decay as a normal dead body
would.

Possession of a creature by means of this spell is blocked by
protection from evil or a similar ward. The subject is allowed
a save vs. Spells to resist. Failure to take over the host
leaves the caster's life force in the magic jar, and that
target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration
of the spell.

If the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the
host body, and the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic
jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities
(including spellcasting ability). The body retains its
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural
abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to
make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access
to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body.

If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is
broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage): If the jar
is in range of the caster's body, the caster's spirit returns to
its body. Otherwise, the caster's spirit departs (the caster
dies). In either case, the spell ends.

If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by dispel
evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the
caster's spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit
returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the
same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the
magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit
departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar (and departs),
and the host's body dies.

If the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken:
If the jar is in range of the host's body, the caster's spirit
departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell
ends. Otherwise, the host's spirit departs, and the caster's
spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell
has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the
caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending
the spell.

In any case where the spell ends with the caster's body
unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die.

Magic Missile  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 1  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell causes a missile of magical energy to dart forth from
the caster's fingertip and strike its target, which must be at
least partially visible to the caster, dealing 1d6+1 points of
damage. The missile strikes unerringly. Specific parts of a
creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not
damaged by the spell.

For every three caster levels beyond 1st, an additional missile
is fired – two at 4th level, three at 7th, four at 10th, and
the maximum of five missiles at 13th level or higher. If the
caster fires multiple missiles, he or she can target a single
creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only
one creature. Targets must be designated before damage is
rolled.

Magic Mouth  Range:  30'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell imbues the chosen non-living object with an enchanted
mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time
a specified event occurs. The message, which may be up to three
words per caster level long, can be in any language known by
the caster and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes, at
any volume from a whisper to a yell. The voice will resemble the
caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use
command words or activate magical effects. It does, however,
move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon
a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to
speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock,
or any other object.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled
according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands
can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only
visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what
appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them.
Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical
darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical
silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed
to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken
word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or
audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or
class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a
6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to
triggers as far as 60 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth
can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in
line of sight or within hearing distance.

Massmorph  Range:  100'+10'/level

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 hour/level

With this spell the caster causes 1d4+1 man-sized (or smaller)
creatures per four caster levels to appear as if they are
natural effects of the terrain (for example, trees in a forest,
stalagmites in a cave, coral underwater, boulders in a cavern,
etc.). All creatures to be affected must be within a 120'
radius of the caster at the time the spell is cast. Only those
creatures the caster wishes to hide are affected, and then only
if they are willing to be concealed. The caster may include
himself or herself among the affected creatures.

Those affected are thus concealed from other creatures passing
through the area for so long as they remain still. If an
affected creature chooses to move or attack, the illusion is
dispelled for that creature, but those who remain still
continue to be hidden. The caster may end the spell early if he
or she wishes by speaking a single word. The illusion can also
be ended by dispel magic.

Mirror Image  Range:  self

Magic-User 2  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell creates several illusory duplicates of the caster.
The images move through each other as well as the real caster
more or less constantly, making it impossible for most
creatures to determine which is real. A total of 1d4 images
plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images
total) are created. These figments separate from the caster and
remain in a cluster around him or her. The figments mimic the
caster's actions, pretending to cast spells, drink potions,
levitate, and so on, just as the caster does. Figments always
look exactly like the caster.

Enemies attempting to attack or cast spells upon the caster will
always hit a figment instead. Any attack against an image
destroys it, whether the attack roll is successful or not;
likewise, attack spells cast directly upon a figment will
destroy it, with no saving throw allowed. Area-effect spells
are not cast directly on the caster, and thus appear to affect
all figments exactly as they affect the caster; for instance,
if the caster is subjected to a fireball, all figments will
appear to be injured just as the caster was.

Neutralize Poison*  Range:  touch

Cleric 4  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or
object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional
effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by
poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1
hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (weapon, trap, etc.)
the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes poison. The caster must make a
successful attack roll; if the attack is a success, the target
must save vs. Poison or die. The caster's touch remains
poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged
(i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

Passwall  Range:  30'

Magic-User 5  Duration:  3 turns

Passwall creates a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone
walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The
passage is up to 10 feet deep plus an additional 10 feet deep
per three caster levels above 9th (20 feet at 12th, 30 feet
deep at 15th, 40 feet deep at 18th). If the wall’s thickness is
more than the depth of the passage created, then a single
passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall
spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick
walls. When passwall ends (due to duration, dispel magic, or
caster's choice), creatures within the passage are ejected out
the nearest exit.

Phantasmal Force  Range:  180'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  concentration

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature
(or small group of creatures), or other effect, as visualized
by the caster up to a maximum size of 20'x20'x20'. The illusion
does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. The
caster can animate the image within the limits of the area of
effect. The image persists so long as the caster concentrates
upon it.

If used to create the illusion of one or more creatures, they
will have an Armor Class of 11 and will disappear if hit in
combat. Damage done by monsters, spells, etc. simulated by this
spell is not real; those “killed” or otherwise apparently
disabled will wake up uninjured (at least from this spell)
after 2d8 rounds. The illusory damage done will be equivalent
to the normal damage for any attack form simulated.

Attempting to animate more creatures than the caster's level
grants viewing creatures with at least average Intelligence an
immediate save vs. Spells to recognize the creatures as
illusions; those making the save will be unaffected by any
actions taken by the illusions from that point on. A similar
save may be granted by the GM any time he or she feels the
illusion is likely to be seen through, especially if the player
describes an illusion which seems improbable or otherwise poorly
conceived.

Polymorph Other  Range:  30'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  permanent

This spell allows the caster to change one target into another
form of living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit
dice than caster’s level, or be incorporeal or gaseous. Unlike
polymorph self, the transformed target also gains the
behavioral and mental traits, any physical attacks, special,
supernatural or spell-like abilities of the new form, in
addition to the physical capabilities and statistics of such.
If the new form is substantially less intelligent, the target
may not remember its former life.

The target creature will have the same number of hit points it
previously had, regardless of the hit dice of the form assumed.
Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to this spell, as
noted above. A creature with shape changing abilities such as a
doppleganger can revert to its natural form in one round.

Unwilling targets that successfully save against Polymorph are
not affected. The spell is permanent until dispelled or the
creature is slain, at which time the target reverts to his or
her original form.

Polymorph Self  Range:  self

Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 hour/level

This spell allows the caster to change into another form of
living creature. The assumed form can’t have more hit dice than
the caster's level. The caster can’t assume an incorporeal or
gaseous form. If slain, the caster reverts to his or her
original form.

The caster gains the physical capabilities and statistics of the
new form but retains his or her own mental abilities. He or she
also gains all physical attacks possessed by the form but does
not gain any special, supernatural or spell-like abilities.
Dragon breath is a special ability, for instance, so were the
caster to assume the form of a dragon he or she could use the
dragon's normal claw, bite, and tail swipe attacks, but not the
dragon's breath.

The caster can remain transformed up to one hour per level of
ability, or may choose to end the spell whenever he or she
desires (up to one hour per level, of course).

Projected Image  Range:  240'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  6 turns

This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster.
The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like
the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions
(including speech). Any further spells cast seem to originate
from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight
between the caster and his or her illusory self must be
maintained or the spell ends. Dimension door, teleport, or any
similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image,
as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note
that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster;
for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able
to see something the caster can't directly see, the caster does
not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the
caster's actual position, not the illusory self's position.

Protection from Evil*

Cleric 1, Magic-User 1  Range:  touch

Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from
mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a
magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The
barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on
saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects
created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of “evil” is
left to the individual GM to decide.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded
creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise
mental control over the creature (including charm spells or
effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from
targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect
for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the
protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting
control does, the would-be controller would then be able to
command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps
out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in
place before the spell is cast.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures
(regardless of whether they are “evil” or not). This causes the
natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the
creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded
creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures
ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to
force the barrier against the blocked creature.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions
in all ways as described above, save that “good” creatures are
kept away, rather than “evil” creatures.

Protection from Evil 10' Radius*

Cleric 4, Magic-User 3  Range:  touch

Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell functions exactly as protection from evil, but with a
10' radius rather than a 1' radius. All within the radius
receive the protection; those who leave and then re-enter, or
who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as
well.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good 10' radius,
and functions exactly as the reversed form of protection from
evil, except that it covers a 10' radius around the target
rather than the normal 1' radius.

Protection from Normal Missiles

Magic-User 3  Range:  self

Duration:  1 turn/level

The caster is completely protected from small sized, non-magical
missile attacks. Therefore, magic arrows, hurled boulders, or
other such are not blocked, but any number of normal arrows,
sling bullets, crossbow bolts, thrown daggers, etc. will be
fended off. Note that normal missiles projected by magic bows
count as magical missiles for the purposes of this spell.

Purify Food and Water

Cleric 1  Range:  10'

Duration:  instantaneous

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise
contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and
drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay
or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of
significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell
has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions.

Quest*  Range:  5'/level

Cleric 5  Duration:  special

Quest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some
service or to refrain from some action or course of activity,
as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to
understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a
quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts
that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any
other course of activity.

A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to
resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may
choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with
the caster to perform some service.

The affected creature must follow the given instructions until
the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his own actions the spell
remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A
clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the quest for 24 hours,
it takes 3d6 points of damage each day.

A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse
spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of
the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel
magic does not affect a quest spell.

Raise Dead*  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell restores life to a deceased human, demi-human or
humanoid. The caster can raise a creature that has been dead
for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the
subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the
subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not
work.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell
loses one level (or 1 hit die) when it is raised, permanently
(i.e. it does not accrue a negative level, but rather loses an
actual level, being reduced to the minimum number of experience
points required for the previous level). If the subject is 1st
level, it loses 1 point of Constitution instead (if this would
reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This
level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any
means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit
dice in the normal fashion.

Also note, a character who died with spells prepared has none
prepared upon being raised.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its
current hit dice. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in
the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and
curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and
repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to
be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still
missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the
dead creature’s equipment or possessions are affected in any
way by this spell.

A creature which has become undead can’t be raised by this
spell. Constructs and elementals cannot be raised. The spell
cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

The reverse of this spell, slay living, will kill instantly the
creature touched (which may be of any sort, not just a human,
demi-human or humanoid) unless a save vs. Spells is made. If
the saving throw is successful, 2d6 damage is dealt to the
victim instead. An attack roll is required to apply this spell
in combat.

Read Languages  Range:  0

Magic-User 1  Duration:  special

This spell grants the caster the ability to read almost any
written language. It may be cast in one of three modes:

In the first mode, the spell allows the caster to read any
number of written works in a variety of languages. This mode
lasts for 1 turn per caster level.

In the second mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one
book or tome; this mode lasts 3 hours per caster level.

In the third mode, the spell allows the caster to read any one
non-magical scroll or other single-sheet document; this mode is
permanent.

This spell does not work on any sort of magical text, such as
spell scrolls or spellbooks; see read magic, below, for the
correct spell to use in such cases.

The spell grants the ability to read the texts, but does not in
any way hasten the reading nor grant understanding of concepts
the caster doesn't otherwise have the ability to understand.
Also, for this spell to function, there must be at least one
living creature that can read the given language somewhere on
the same plane. The knowledge is not copied from that
creature's mind; rather, it is the existence of the knowledge
that enables the spell to function.

Read Magic  Range:  0

Magic-User 1  Duration:  permanent

When cast upon any magical text, such as a spellbook or
magic-user spell scroll, this spell enables the caster to read
that text. Casting this spell on a cursed text will generally
trigger the curse. All Magic-Users begin play knowing this
spell, and it can be prepared even if the Magic-User loses
access to his or her spellbook.

Regenerate  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes the subject’s severed body members (fingers,
toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of
multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs to grow
back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is
complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and
touching the creature. Otherwise, a full turn is required for
the regeneration to complete.

This spell also heals 3d8 points of damage. Regenerate has no
effect on nonliving creatures or constructs (including undead).

Reincarnate  Range:  touch

Magic-User 6  Duration:  instantaneous

With this spell, the caster brings back a dead character (or
humanoid creature) in another body, provided that its death
occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell
and the subject’s soul is free and willing to return. If the
subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not
work.

Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature
the character becomes:

d%

Incarnation

01–02

Bugbear

03–17

Dwarf

18–28

Elf

29

Gnoll

30–39

Gnome

40–44

Goblin

45–63

Halfling

64–88

Human

89–92

Kobold

93

Lizard Man

94–98

Orc

99

Troglodyte

100

Other (GM's choice)

Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all
physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of
the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of
the character’s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but
the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the
character’s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell
creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to
inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes
one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is
reincarnated.

A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life
and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's
ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new
form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.)
The subject’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a
real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to
magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total
from the character's original hit point total; this is the new
form's hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a
hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by
2.

A character that has been turned into an undead creature or
killed by a death effect can’t be returned to life by this
spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can’t be
reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has
died of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with
its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural
armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like,
but it doesn’t automatically speak the language of the new
form.

Remove Curse*  Range:  30'

Cleric 3, Magic-User 4  Duration:  instantaneous

Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or
a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a
cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell
typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed
item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may
not be countered by this spell or may be removed only by a
caster of a certain level.

The reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to
place a curse on the subject. A save vs. Spells is allowed to
resist. The caster must choose one of the following three
effects:

–4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).

–4 penalty on attack rolls and saves.

Each round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act
normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

The caster may also invent his or her own curse, but it should
be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus
bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a
remove curse spell.

Remove Fear*  Range:  touch (120')

Cleric 1  Duration:  instantaneous

(2 turns)

This spell will calm the creature touched. If the target
creature is currently subject to any sort of magical fear, it
is allowed a new save vs. Spells to resist that fear, at a
bonus of +1 per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, cause fear, causes one target
creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails
to save vs. Spells, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or
more hit dice are immune to this effect.

Resist Cold  Range:  touch

Cleric 1  Duration:  1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold.
Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate
clothing) is ignored by the affected creature. Against more
significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the
affected creature gains a bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all
damage from such attacks is reduced by half (round up).

Resist Fire  Range:  touch

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and
heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is
ignored by the affected creature. Against more significant heat
or fire (such as a fireball), the affected creature gains a
bonus of +3 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks
is reduced by half (round up).

Restoration  Range:  touch

Cleric 6  Duration:  permanent

Each casting of the spell removes a single negative level from a
creature who has suffered energy drain. At 16th level, two
negative levels may be removed. See the rules for Energy Drain
(in the Encounter section) for more details.

Alternately, this spell can be used to restore drained ability
score points. If applied to a character who has suffered
temporary loss of ability points, it will restore up to 1d4
lost points to any one drained ability immediately. If applied
to a character who has suffered permanent loss of ability
points, 1 point can be restored.

Restoration does not restore levels lost due to death (as
described for the spell raise dead).

Shield  Range:  self

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 rounds+1/level

Shield creates an invisible, shield-like mobile disk of force
that hovers in front of the caster. It negates magic missile
attacks directed at the caster, and improves the caster's Armor
Class by +3 vs. melee attacks and +6 vs. missile weapons. The
Armor Class benefits do not apply to attacks originating from
behind the caster, but magic missiles are warded off from all
directions.

Silence 15' Radius

Cleric 2  Range:  360'

Duration:  2 rounds/level

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within
a 15' radius around the target. All sound is stopped:
Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise
whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The
spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect
stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can
be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the
creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a
save vs. Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another
creature’s possession is targeted, that creature also receives
a save vs. Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense
against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.

Sleep  Range:  90'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  5 rounds/level

This spell puts several creatures of 3 or fewer hit dice into a
magical slumber. Creatures of 4 or more hit dice are not
affected. The caster chooses a point of origin for the spell
(within the given range, of course), and those creatures within
30' of the chosen point may be affected. Each creature in the
area of effect is allowed a save vs. Spells to resist the
effect.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an
affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not
affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures,
and such creatures in the area of effect are ignored.

When the duration elapses, the sleeping creatures normally wake
up immediately; however, if they are made very comfortable and
the surroundings are quiet, the affected creatures may continue
sleeping normally, at the GM's option.

Speak with Animals

Cleric 2  Range:  special

Duration:  1 turn/4 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one animal
(normal or giant sized, but not magical or monstrous) that is
in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The caster
may change which animal he or she is speaking with at will,
once per round. The spell doesn’t alter the animal’s reaction
or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should
be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals
are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones
make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward
the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.

Speak with Monsters

Cleric 6  Range:  special

Duration:  1 turn/5 levels

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one monster
that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him or her. The
caster may change which monster he or she is speaking with at
will, once per round. Others able to understand the language
spoken by the target monster (if any) will be able to
understand the caster. The spell doesn’t alter the monster’s
reaction or attitude towards the caster. Furthermore, more
intelligent monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while
less intelligent ones make inane comments. If a monster is
friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or
service for him or her. Mindless monsters, plant creatures and
undead are unaffected by this spell.

Speak with Plants  Range:  20'

Cleric 4  Duration:  1 turn

The caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal
plants and plant creatures. A normal plant’s sense of its
surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to give (or
recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer
questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The
spell doesn’t alter the plant’s reaction or attitude towards
the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate
freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance
to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse
and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other
monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it
may decide to do some favor or service for him or her. Normal
plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally
perform “services” other than to answer questions.

Speak with Dead  Range:  10'

Cleric 3  Duration:  3 rounds/level

This spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a
corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster
puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster
levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires.
The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the creature knew
during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers
are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the
past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell
on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but
the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged
corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct
answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at
all.

This spell does not let the caster actually speak to the person
(whose soul has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted
knowledge “stored” in the corpse. The partially animated body
retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and
thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had
while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information.
Indeed, it can’t even remember being questioned.

This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an
undead creature.

Spiritual Hammer  Range:  30'

Cleric 2  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell causes a warhammer made of pure force to spring into
existence, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within range
once per round. It deals 1d6 hit points of damage per strike,
+1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +5). It uses the
caster’s normal attack bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and
thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by
magic weapons. If the hammer goes beyond the spell range, the
Cleric loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it,
the hammer disappears. The hammer cannot be attacked or harmed
by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod
of cancellation will dispel it.

Sticks to Snakes  Range:  120'

Cleric 4  Duration:  6 turns

This spell transforms normal wooden sticks into 1d4 hit dice
worth of normal (not giant) snakes per every four caster
levels. (See the Monsters section for details on types of
snakes.) The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When
slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to
their original stick form. Magical “sticks” such as enchanted
staves cannot be affected.

Striking  Range:  touch

Cleric 3  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell bestows upon one weapon the ability to deal 1d6
points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on
each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It
provides no attack bonus, but if cast on a normal weapon, the
spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be
affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such
a monster, however.

Telekinesis  Range:  self

Magic-User 5  Duration:  3 turns

This spell permits the caster to move objects or creatures by
concentration alone. An object weighing no more than 50 pounds
per caster level can be moved up to 20 feet per round. A
creature can negate the effect on itself or an object it holds
or has on its body with a successful save vs. Death Ray. In
order to use this power, the caster must maintain
concentration, moving no more than normal movement (no
running), making no attacks and casting no spells. If
concentration is lost (whether intentional or not), the power
may be used again on the next round, but the subject of the
effect is allowed a new saving throw.

Teleport  Range:  self

Magic-User 5  Duration:  instantaneous

This spell instantly transports the caster to a designated
destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster
level. Interplanar travel is not possible. The caster can bring
along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100
pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with
all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although
creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another,
with at least one of those creatures in contact with the
caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs.
Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an
attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a
successful save vs. Spells will prevent items in a creature's
possession from being teleported.

The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout
of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more
likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong
magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even
impossible.

To determine the results of this spell, roll d% and consult the
table below. Below the table is an explanation of the terms
used.

81–92

93–100

Familiarity: “Very familiar” is a place where the caster has
been very often and feels at home. “Studied carefully” is a
place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be
seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as
scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one
hour. “Seen casually” is a place that the caster has seen more
than once but with which he or she is not very familiar.
“Viewed once” is a place that the caster has seen once,
possibly using magic.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if
the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that
no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to
no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80.

On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired.

Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away
from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target
is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The
direction off target is determined randomly.

Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that’s visually or
thematically similar to the target area. This means that the
caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no
such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply
fails instead.

Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster
have gotten “scrambled.” Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then
reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these
rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the
characters take more damage and must reroll.

True Seeing  Range:  touch

Cleric 5  Duration:  1 round/level

This spell confers on the target the ability to see all things
as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and
magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact
locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through
normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or
objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true
form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range
of true seeing conferred is 120 feet.

True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no
way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate
concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In
addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with
known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal
ball or in conjunction with clairvoyance.

Ventriloquism  Range:  60'

Magic-User 1  Duration:  1 turn/level

This spell allows the caster to cause his or her voice to sound
from someplace else within range, for example, from a dark
alcove or statue.

Wall of Fire  Range:  180'

Cleric 5, Magic-User 4  Duration:  1 round/level

(or special)

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs
into existence. One side of the wall, selected by the caster,
sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to
creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those
beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage
when it appears and on the caster's turn each round to all
creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points
+1 point per caster level of fire damage to any creature
passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead
creatures.

The wall is either a sheet of flame up to 20' in length per
caster level, or a ring with a radius up to 5' per caster
level. The caster may choose to make the wall smaller if
desired. The wall may be up to 20' tall (as desired by the
caster and/or constrained by the ceiling).

If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures
are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall;
a save vs. Spells is allowed, with success indicating that
damage is rolled as if the creature is within 10' of the wall.

The caster may choose to maintain the spell indefinitely (within
reasonable limits of endurance) by concentration, or may cast it
with the standard duration of 1 round per level, at his or her
option.

Wall of Iron  Range:  90'

Magic-User 6  Duration:  permanent

This spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into
being. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square
section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so
desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding
nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall
cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a
creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat
plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available
space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the
ground.

The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a
proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the
thickness halves the area. The wall may not be made less than
one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically
resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so
that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures
beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction
if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction
rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13
Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or
several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional
Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is
sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the
falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray
(with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or
smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The
wall cannot crush larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation,
and other natural phenomena.

Wall of Stone  Range:  15' per level

Magic-User 5  Duration:  permanent

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining
rock surfaces. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square
section, 1' thick, per caster level. The caster can double the
wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be
conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
another object.

[-- Image: graphics108 --]The caster can create a wall of stone
in almost any shape he or she desires. The wall created need
not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it
must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It
can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For
this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be
arched and buttressed, reducing the spell’s area by half. The
wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations,
battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and
chipping.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within
or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can
hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with
successful saves vs. Death Ray.

Water Breathing  Range:  touch

Magic-User 3  Duration:  2 hours/level

The affected creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the
duration evenly among all the creatures the caster touches. The
spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.

Web  Range:  10' per level

Magic-User 2  Duration:  2 turns/level

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands,
filling a volume of 8,000 cubic feet (equivalent to eight
10'x10'x10' cubes). The strands are similar to spider webs but
far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or
more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web
collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation,
the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes,
up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume.
The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she
wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among
the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause the
attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected
area will.

Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a
save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is
entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is
reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled
creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks;
whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide.
Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web,
it will be able to act normally again.

If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move or
perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible,
however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more
hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such
creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as
given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having
Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped
until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the
webs alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will
spread to adjacent 10' cubes each round until all the webbing
is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means). All
creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage
from the flames, but if they survive they are completely free
afterwards.

Wizard Eye  Range:  240'

Magic-User 4  Duration:  6 turns

With this spell the caster creates an invisible magical “eye”
through which he or she can see. The eye has Darkvision, but
otherwise sees exactly as the caster would. It can be created
in any place the caster can see, up to a range of 240' away,
and thereafter can move at a rate of 40' per round as directed
by the caster. The eye will not move more than 240' feet away
from the caster under any circumstances. The eye cannot pass
through solid objects, but as it is exactly the size of a
normal human's eye, it can pass through holes as small as 1
inch in diameter. The caster must concentrate to use the eye.

Wizard Lock  Range:  20'

Magic-User 2  Duration:  permanent

A wizard lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically
locks it. The caster can freely pass his or her own wizard lock
without affecting it, as can any Magic-User 3 or more levels
higher than the caster of the wizard lock; otherwise, a door or
object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in
or with a successful dispel magic or knock spell.

Word of Recall  Range:  self (special)

Cleric 6  Duration:  instantaneous

Word of recall teleports the caster instantly back to his or her
sanctuary when a single word is uttered. The caster must
designate the sanctuary when he or she prepares the spell, and
it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival
is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The
caster can be transported any distance within a plane but
cannot travel between planes. The caster can bring along
objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds
per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all
objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures
to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at
least one of those creatures in contact with the caster).

An unwilling creature can’t be teleported by word of recall.
Likewise, a creature’s save vs. Spells prevents items in its
possession from being teleported.

PART 4: THE ADVENTURE

Time and Scale

Time in the dungeon is measured in game turns, which are
(approximately) 10 minutes long. When combat begins, the time
scale changes to combat rounds, which are (approximately) 10
seconds long. Thus, there are 60 combat rounds per game turn.

Distances in the dungeon are measured in feet. Outdoors, change
all distance measurements (movement, range, etc.) to yards (so
100' becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for
spells, for instance) normally remain in feet.

Dungeon Adventures

Carrying Capacity

Normal Human, Elven and Dwarvish player characters are able to
carry up to 60 pounds and still be considered lightly loaded,
or up to 150 pounds and be considered heavily loaded. Halflings
may carry up to 50 pounds and be considered lightly loaded, or
up to 100 pounds and be heavily loaded. Note that armor for
Halfling characters is about one-quarter as heavy as armor for
the other races.

These figures are affected by Strength; each +1 of Strength
bonus adds 10% to the capacity of the character, while each -1
deducts 20%. Thus, carrying capacities for normal characters
are as shown below (rounded to the nearest 5 pounds for
convenience):

The carrying capacities of various domesticated animals are

animal.

Movement and Encumbrance

The movement rate of a character or creature is expressed as the
number of feet it can move per combat round. The normal player
character races can all move 40' per round. When exploring a
dungeon, time is expressed in turns, as explained above; normal
movement per turn is 3 times the movement rate per round.

This may seem slow, but this rate of movement includes such
things as drawing maps, watching out for traps and monsters
(though they may still surprise the party), etc. In a combat
situation, on the other hand, everyone is moving around
swiftly, and such things as drawing maps are not important.

A character's movement rate is adjusted by his or her
Encumbrance (the load he or she is carrying) as follows:

Armor Type

Lightly Loaded

Heavily Loaded

No Armor or Magic Leather

40'

30'

Leather Armor or Magic Metal

30'

20'

Metal Armor

20'

10'

Count the weight of armor worn when calculating encumbrance,
because armor counts both for bulk and restrictiveness as well
as for weight. Magic armor counts for its full weight but is
not as bulky and restrictive as normal armor, thus granting an
improved movement rate.

Mapping

In any dungeon expedition, making maps is important. Generally
one player will do this, drawing a map on graph paper as the
Game Master describes each room or corridor. Absolute accuracy
is usually not possible; the main thing is to ensure that the
party can find its way back out of the dungeon.

Light

A torch or lantern will provide light covering a 30' radius; dim
light will extend about 20' further. Normal torches burn for
1d4+4 turns, while a flask of oil in a lantern will burn for
18+1d6 turns. A candle will shed light over a 5' radius, with
dim light extending 5' further. In general, taper candles such
as are used for illumination will burn about 3 turns per inch
of height.

Darkvision

Some character races, and almost all monsters, have Darkvision.
This gives them the ability to see even in total darkness.
Darkvision is black and white only but otherwise like normal
sight. Darkvision does not grant one the ability to see in
magical darkness. The range of Darkvision is typically either
30' or 60'; if not given for a particular creature, assume the
60' range.

[-- Image: graphics15 --]Darkvision is totally ineffective in
any light greater than moonlight.

Doors

A stuck door can be opened on a roll of 1 on 1d6; add the
character's Strength bonus to the range, so that a character
with a bonus of +2 can open a stuck door on a roll of 1-3 on
1d6.

Locked doors can be forced by rolling the same range, but on
1d10. Metal bars can sometimes be bent on a roll of this range
on 1d20.

A careful character might choose to listen at a door before
opening it. Thieves have a special ability, Listen, which
should be applied if the listener is a Thief. For other
characters, the GM rolls 1d6, with 1 indicating success. Sounds
heard might include voices, footsteps, or any other sound the GM
considers appropriate. Of course, the room beyond the door might
really be silent; thus, the Game Master must make the roll, so
that a roll of 1 in such a case will not give anything away to
the players.

Traps

Dungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including
spear-throwers, covered pits, etc. The GM will decide what is
required to trigger a trap, and what happens when the trap is
triggered. (Some guidance on this is provided in the Game
Master section later in this book.) In general, there will be
some way to avoid or reduce the effect of the trap being
sprung. For instance, a save vs. Death Ray is often used to
avoid falling into a covered pit (with Dexterity bonus added),
while spear-throwers, automated crossbows, and the like are
sometimes treated as if they were monsters (attacking vs. the
victim's Armor Class at some given attack bonus).

Normal characters have a chance equal to a roll of 1 on 1d6 to
detect a trap if a search for one is made. Note that this is
about a 16.7% chance; Thieves have a special ability to find
and remove traps, which supersedes this roll, as does the
stonework trap-finding ability of Dwarves. A Dwarven Thief is a
special case; apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher.
In all cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10'
square area. A single character may only effectively search a
given area for traps once, even if the character has more than
one trap-detection roll “type” allowed (such as the Dwarven
Thief above).

Trap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely magical
in nature; on the other hand, in such cases Magic-Users and/or
Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at the given 1 in
1d6 chance, at the Game Master's option.

Secret Doors

Under normal conditions, searching for secret doors takes one
turn per character per 10' of wall searched. A secret door is
found on a roll of 1 on 1d6; characters with 15 or higher
Intelligence succeed on a roll of 1-2. Also, as noted
previously, Elves add 1 to the range automatically, such that
an Elf discovers secret doors on a 1-2 on 1d6, or 1-3 if the
Elf has an Intelligence of 15 or higher. The GM may create
secret doors that are more difficult (or easier) to detect at
his or her option.

Multiple characters searching for secret doors ensures that any
such will eventually be found; however, if the first and second
searchers fail, the next searcher must take two turns to search,
and all subsequent searches of the area require an hour.

Note that finding a secret door does not grant understanding of
how it works. The GM may require additional rolls or other
actions to be taken before the door can be opened.

Dungeon Survival

As described in the Equipment section, above, normal characters
must consume one day's worth of rations (or equivalent food)
and at least one quart of water per day.

Failure to consume enough food does not significantly affect a
character for the first two days, after which he or she loses 1
hit point per day. Furthermore, at that point the character
loses the ability to heal wounds normally, though magic will
still work. Eating enough food for a day (over the course of
about a day, not all at once) restores the ability to heal, and
the character will recover lost hit points at the normal rate.

Inadequate water affects characters more swiftly; after a single
day without adequate water, the character loses 1d4 hit points,
and will lose an additional 1d4 hit points per day thereafter;
healing ability is lost when the first die of damage is rolled.

Wilderness Adventures

Wilderness Movement Rates

Movement rates when traveling in the wilderness are related
directly to encounter movement rates, as shown on the table
below:

Encounter Movement

(Feet per Round)

Wilderness Movement

(Miles per Day)

Naturally, any group traveling together moves at the rate of the
slowest member.

Overland Travel

The movement rates shown on the table above are figured based on
an 8 hour day of travel through open, clear terrain. The terrain
type will alter the rate somewhat, as shown on this table:

Terrain

Adjustment

Jungle, Mountains, Swamp

x1/3

Desert, Forest, Hills

x2/3

Clear, Plains, Trail

x1

Road (Paved)

x1 1/3

Characters may choose to perform a forced march, traveling 12
hours per day. If this is done, add an additional 50% to the
distance traveled. Each day of forced march performed after the
first inflicts 1d6 damage on the characters (and their animals,
if any). A save vs. Death Ray with Constitution bonus applied
is allowed to avoid this damage, but after this save is failed
once, it is not rolled again for that character or creature. A
day spent resting “restarts” the progression.

Waterborne Travel

Travel by water may be done in a variety of boats or ships; see
the table in the Vehicles section for details. Travel distances
are based on a 12 hour day of travel, rather than the usual 8
hours per day given above. Note that sailed ships may travel 24
hours per day (if a qualified navigator is aboard), and so may
be able to cover twice the normal distance per day of travel.
This is in addition to the multiplier given below. If the ship
stops each night, as is done by some vessels traveling along a
coastline as well as those vessels having less than the minimum
number of regular crewmen on board, the two-times multiplier
does not apply.

Movement of sailed ships varies depending on weather conditions,
as shown on the following table. Sailing movement modifiers
shown apply when sailing with the wind; sailing against the
wind involves tacking (called “zigzagging” by landlubbers)
which reduces movement rates as indicated on the table.

Notes:

Becalmed: Sailing ships cannot move. Oared ships may move at the
given rowing movement rate.

Very Strong Winds: Sailing against the wind (tacking) is not
possible.

Gale: Sailing against the wind is not possible, and ships
exposed to a gale may be damaged or sunk; apply 2d8 points of
damage to any such ship, per hour sailed.

Traveling by Air

When traveling by air, overland movement rates are doubled, and
all terrain effects are ignored. Most winged creatures must
maintain at least one-third normal forward movement in order to
remain airborne; however, devices such as flying carpets
generally do not have this limitation.

Becoming Lost

Adventurers following roads, trails, rivers, streams, or other
obvious landmarks are unlikely to become lost; however, when
the party strikes out into trackless forest, windblown desert,
etc., they may become lost. Secretly roll a save vs. Death Ray,
adjusted by the Wisdom of the party leader (i.e., whichever
player character seems to be leading). (Alternately, an Ability
Roll against Wisdom may be rolled, if that optional rule is in
use.) The GM must determine the effects of a failed roll.

Retainers, Specialists and Mercenaries

Player characters will sometimes want or need to hire NPCs
(Non-Player Characters) to work for them. There are several
categories of NPCs available for hire, as follows:

Retainers

A retainer is a close associate of his employer. Retainers are
hired for a share of treasure (typically at least 15% of the
employer's income) plus support costs (weapons, armor, rations,
and basic equipment provided by the employer). Retainers are
typically very loyal and are willing to take reasonable risks;
in particular, they are the only sort of hireling who will
generally accompany a player character into a dungeon, lair, or
ruin.

Hiring a retainer is more involved than hiring other NPCs.
First, the player character must advertise for a retainer,
typically by hiring a crier, posting notices in public places,
or asking (and possibly paying) NPCs such as innkeepers or
taverners to direct potential retainers to the player
character. It is up to the Game Master to rule on what must be
done, and how successful these activities are.

If the player character is successful, one or more NPCs will
present themselves to be interviewed. The Game Master should
play out the interview with the player, and after all offers
have been made and all questions asked, a reaction roll should
be made. To check the potential retainer's reaction, the Game
Master rolls 2d6 and adds the player character's Charisma
bonus. In addition, the Game Master may apply any adjustments
he or she feels are appropriate (a bonus of +1 for
higher-than-average pay or the offer of a magic item such as a
sword +1, or a penalty if the player character offers poor
terms). The roll is read as follows:

Adjusted Die Roll

Result

2 or less

Refusal, -1 on further rolls

3-5

Refusal

6-8

Try again

9-11

Acceptance

12 or more

Acceptance, +1 to Loyalty

Refusal, -1 on further rolls means that all further reaction
rolls made toward that player character in the given town or
region will be at a penalty of -1 due to unkind words said by
the NPC to his fellows. If the player character tries again in
a different town, the penalty does not apply.

If a Try again result is rolled, the potential retainer is
reluctant, and needs more convincing; the player character must
“sweeten” the deal in order to get an additional roll, such as
by offering more pay, a magic item, etc. If the player character
makes no better offer, treat Try again as a Refusal result.

Loyalty: All retainers have a Loyalty score, which is generally
7 plus the employer's Charisma bonus (or penalty). The Loyalty
score is used just as the Morale score of monsters or
mercenaries is used.

If a Loyalty check roll made in combat is a natural 2, the
Loyalty of the retainer increases by +1 point. Note that a
Loyalty of 12 is fanatical… the retainer will do virtually
anything the player character asks, and never flee in combat.
However, the Game Master should still apply penalties when the
player character instructs the retainer to do something which
appears very risky, making a failed check possible.

In addition, the Game Master should roll a Loyalty check for
each retainer at the end of each adventure, after treasure is
divided, to determine if the retainer will remain with the
player character. The GM may apply adjustments to this roll,
probably no more than two points plus or minus, if the retainer
is particularly well or poorly paid.

Maximum Number of Retainers: A player character may hire at most
4 retainers, adjusted by the character's Charisma bonus or
penalty. Any attempts to hire more than this number of
retainers will be met with automatic refusals.

Level of Retainers: Normally, potential retainers will be
one-half the level of the employer (or less). So, a first level
character cannot hire retainers, second level PCs can only hire
first level characters, and so on. Of course, there is no way
for the retainers to directly know the level of the PC
employer, nor for the employer to know the level of the
potential retainer; but the Game Master should usually enforce
this rule for purposes of game balance. It shouldn't be
surprising that first level characters can't hire retainers, as
they have no reputation to speak of yet.

Experience for Retainers: Unlike other hired NPCs, retainers do
gain experience just as other adventurers do; however, as they
are under the command of a player character, only one-half of a
share of XP is allocated to each retainer. See Character
Advancement, below, for an example.

Specialists

Specialists are NPCs who may be hired by player characters to
perform various tasks. Specialists do not go on adventures or
otherwise risk their lives fighting monsters, disarming traps,
or any of the other dangerous things player characters and
retainers may do. Rather, specialists perform services the
player characters usually can't perform for themselves, like
designing and erecting castles, training animals, or operating
ships.

A player character is limited in the number of specialists he or
she can hire only by the amount of money they cost; Charisma
does not affect this.

Alchemist: 1,000 gp per month. These characters are generally
hired for one of two reasons: to make potions, or to assist a
Magic-User with magical research.

An alchemist can produce a potion, given the required materials
and a sample or a written formula for the potion, in the same
time and for the same cost as a Magic-User. They may also
research new potions, but at twice the cost in time and
materials as a Magic-User.

Alternately, a Magic-User seeking to create certain magic items
may employ an alchemist as an assistant. In this case, the
alchemist adds 15% to the Magic-User's chance of success.

Animal Trainer: 250 to 750 gp per month. Characters wishing to
ride hippogriffs or employ carnivorous apes as guards will need
the assistance of an animal trainer. The lowest cost above is
for an average animal trainer, able to train one type of
“normal” animal such as carnivorous apes; those able to train
more than one sort of animal, or to train monstrous creatures
such as hippogriffs, are more expensive to hire. The Game
Master must decide how long it takes to train an animal; in
some cases, animal training may take years, a fact the player
characters may find inconvenient as well as expensive. A single
animal trainer can train and manage no more than 5 animals at a
time, though in most cases once an animal is fully trained, if
it is put into service right away the animal trainer won't be
needed to handle it any longer.

Armorer (or Weaponsmith): 100 to 500 gp per month. Characters
hiring mercenaries, or having armed and armored followers to
take care of, will need the services of an armorer. In general,
for every 50 Fighters employed, one armorer is required to care
for their gear. The armorer's equipment is not included in the
costs given above, but the cost to maintain his apprentices is
included; most such characters will have 1d4 apprentices
assisting.

Higher priced armorers or weaponsmiths may be hired to assist in
making magic weapons or armor; in this case, the character hired
will be a specialist, an expert in making one particular type of
armor or weapon, and will command a higher price (as shown
above). Such characters will rarely agree to do the mundane
work of maintaining weapons and armor for a military unit.

Engineer: 750 gp per month. Any player character wishing to
build a fortress, a ship, or any other mundane construction
will need an engineer. Large projects may require several
engineers, at the GM's option.

Savant: 1,500 gp per month. Savants are experts in ancient and
obscure knowledge. Many savants have particular interests in
very limited or focused areas (for example, “Elven migrations
of the 2nd age”), but even these will know or have access to a
lot of facts. The listed cost is the minimum required to
maintain a savant with his library, collections, etc. If the
savant's patron asks a difficult question, there may be
additional costs for materials or research to answer it.

Ship's Crew: Special. A crew for a waterborne vessel involves
several types of characters. At the very least, a complement of
sailors and a Captain are needed; rowers will be needed aboard
galleys, and a Navigator is required aboard ships going out of
sight of land.

Costs per month for each sort of character are given below:

Seaman Type

Cost

Captain

300 gp

Navigator

200 gp

Sailor

10 gp

Rower

3 gp

In general, all such characters are normal men, and are not
armored; they will usually be armed with clubs, daggers, or
shortswords. Player characters with appropriate backgrounds may
act as Captain, but unless experienced as a ship's captain, they
will have difficulty commanding respect from the regular sailors
(lower the Morale of such regular sailors by -2 if led by an
inexperienced Captain).

Mercenaries

Mercenaries are hired warriors. They are generally hired in
units as small as platoons: 32 to 48 Fighters, divided into two
to four squads of soldiers; each squad is led by a corporal,
while the platoon is led by a lieutenant plus a sergeant.
Platoons are joined together into companies, each generally
consisting of two to five platoons and led by a captain with a
sergeant as his assistant (called a first sergeant).

As mercenaries are almost always veteran troops, the average
mercenary is a 1st level Fighter; 10% of corporals and 50% of
sergeants are 2nd level. A mercenary lieutenant will generally
be 2nd level, while a captain will be 2nd to 4th level and his
first sergeant will be 2nd or 3rd level. Larger mercenary units
will usually be beyond the reach of player characters until they
have reached fairly high levels, and are left to the Game Master
to detail.

Mercenaries will virtually never go into a dungeon, lair, or
ruin, at least until it has been fully cleared. Rather, they
are used in outdoor military engagements; high level player
characters may hire mercenaries to defend or help defend their
castles or other holdings.

Mercenaries housed in a player character's stronghold require
200 square feet each but cost 25% less per month, as this is
covered by their room and board. (Elven mercenaries, however,
require 500 square feet of space each in order to reduce their
pay, as they demand better living conditions.) See the
Stronghold section for more details.

[-- Image: graphics109 --]Statistics are given below for the
most common sorts of mercenaries; the statistics are for first
level characters, and should be adjusted when higher level
characters are indicated (as given above). In particular,
multiply the given cost of each mercenary by his or her level.
Listed costs are in gold pieces per month.

Character Advancement

Experience Points (XP)

Experience points are given for monsters defeated, and for other
challenges as the GM sees fit. The following table provides XP
values for monsters. Where a monster has both a character level
and hit dice given, use the larger value as the monster's level.
Non-combat challenges may be assigned a level, or a flat XP
value assigned, as the GM wishes.

If asterisks appear after the hit dice listing for a monster,
each asterisk adds the special ability bonus once; for example,
a creature with a hit dice figure of 2** is worth 125 XP.

For monsters with more than 25 hit dice, add 750 XP to the XP
Value and 25 XP to the Special Ability Bonus per additional hit
die.

NPCs should be treated as monsters of a number of hit dice
equivalent to the character's level. Add a special ability
bonus for Clerics and Magic-Users if they are able to cast
useful spells during the encounter.

[-- Image: graphics12 --]After tallying the XP earned in a given
adventure, the amount should be divided by the number of
adventurers. As described above, each retainer should receive a
one-half share; so a group with four player characters and a
retainer is counted as having 4½ members. If 2,000 XP are
earned by this group, one share is 444 XP, and the retainer
receives 222 XP.

No character may advance more than one level due to the
experience points from a single adventure. For example, Barthal
the Thief is 1st level and has 1,000 XP before going on an
adventure; during the adventure, he earns 2,000 more XP (an
amazing feat). This would make his total 3,000 XP, and he would
be a 3rd level Thief. This is not allowed; instead, he advances
to 2,499 XP, one short of the amount required for 3rd level,
and starts his next adventure at 2nd level.

PART 5: THE ENCOUNTER

I raised my shield to fend off one of the monsters, and hewed at
another with my sword, but I missed my first swing. Morningstar
swung at one of the monsters and struck it, but her sword did
the bony thing little harm. I saw that Apoqulis still stood by
the door; of Barthal there was no sign. Fortunately, Apoqulis
also had a torch.

Apoqulis raised his holy symbol and called in a loud voice, “In
the name of Tah, begone!” To my surprise, several of the
monsters turned as if afraid and ran out the door, disappearing
into the gloom. Unfortunately this left quite a few of them
still in the room.

Even as I saw all this I continued to hack at the monsters. It
took two good blows to down the first one; it appeared that
Morningstar was having similar trouble with the monsters. Then
one of the skeletons hit her, just a minor wound, but still I
felt good that I had invested my part of the proceeds of our
last excursion in a suit of plate mail armor; I was shrugging
off blows that would have harmed me were I still wearing chain
mail.

To my surprise, I saw Apoqulis down one of the monsters in a
single blow, then do the same to another in his very next
strike. His mace seemed to be much more effective against the
monsters than our swords. As I finally managed to down a second
skeleton, I heard a high-pitched yell… it was Barthal, a little
ways down the hallway, and he was throwing something.

There was a sound of glass breaking, and I felt a splash of
water on my face. Several of the skeletons began to smoke, and
then one of them fell in a heap. Holy water, I decided, but I
didn't have time to think about it. I just kept hacking at the
skeletons.

By the time they were all gone, I had taken a wound, and
Morningstar had taken a second. We had one potion of healing
left of those that Apoqulis' temple had given us; Morningstar
told me to drink it, but I could tell she was in worse shape
than I, so I insisted she take it.

Then we turned back to the sarcophagus…

Order of Play

When the party of adventurers comes in contact with potential
enemies, time shifts to combat rounds (10 seconds long, as
described previously). Before beginning combat, surprise is
checked (see below). Unsurprised characters then roll for
Initiative, and act in order of the rolls (again, as described
below).

Surprise

When surprise is possible, roll 1d6 for each side which might be
surprised; most normal characters are surprised on a roll of
1-2. Surprised characters are unable to act for one round.
Characters or creatures which are well hidden and prepared to
perform an ambush surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. Some
characters or creatures (such as Elves) are described as being
less likely to be surprised; reduce the range by 1 for such
creatures.

For example: Darion the Human Fighter and Morningstar the Elven
Fighter/Magic-User open a door and come face-to-face with a
party of goblins. The GM rolls 1d6 for the goblins; on a 1-2
they are all surprised. Then the GM rolls 1d6 for Darion and
Morningstar. If the roll is a 1, both of them are surprised; if
the roll is a 2, only Darion is surprised. If the roll is 3 or
more, neither of them are surprised.

Surprised characters or creatures stand flat-footed for one
round. They still defend themselves, so there is no penalty to
Armor Class, but they cannot move nor attack during the round
of surprise.

Monster Reactions

When a group of player characters meet one or more monsters,
it's important to know how the monsters will react to the
party. In many cases, the reaction of the monster or monsters
is obvious… zombies guarding a tomb will virtually always
attack intruders, for example.

In cases where the reaction of the monsters to the party is not
obvious, a reaction roll may be made. The Game Master rolls
2d6, adding the Charisma bonus of the “lead” character (or
applying his or her Charisma penalty) along with any other
adjustments he or she feels are reasonable, and consults the
table below:

Reaction Roll Table

Adjusted Die Roll

Result

2 or less

Immediate Attack

3-7

Unfavorable

8-11

Favorable

12 or more

Very Favorable

A result of 2 or less means that the player characters have so
offended the monsters that they attack immediately. An
Unfavorable result means that the monsters do not like the
player characters, and will attack if they may reasonably do
so. A Favorable result simply means that the monsters will
consider letting the player characters live if they choose to
parley; it does not necessarily mean that the monsters like the
player characters. A Very Favorable result means that the
monsters (or perhaps only the monster leader) do, in fact, like
the player characters; this does not mean that the monsters will
just hand over their treasure, but it does indicate that they
may choose to cooperate with the player characters in mutually
beneficial ways.

As always, interpreting the results of this roll is left to the
GM, who may choose to alter the result if he or she believes a
different result would be more enjoyable to play out than the
one rolled.

Initiative

Each round, 1d6 is rolled for Initiative for each character or
monster. This roll is adjusted by the character's Dexterity
bonus. High numbers act first. Any characters/monsters with
equal numbers act simultaneously. The GM may make single rolls
for groups of identical monsters at his or her option.

As the GM counts down the Initiative numbers, each character or
monster may act on his or her number. If desired, a combatant
can choose to wait until a later number to act. If a player
states that he or she is waiting for another character or
monster to act, then the player character's action takes place
on the same Initiative number as the creature he or she is
waiting for. In this case, the player character's action is
simultaneous with the creature waited for, just as if they had
rolled the same number.

[-- Image: Image10 --]A character using a weapon with a long
reach (spears, for instance) may choose to attack a closing
opponent on the closing opponent's number and thus attack
simultaneously with the opponent, even if the character rolled
lower for Initiative.

[-- Image: graphics13 --]Combat

Each character or creature involved in combat may move, if
desired, up to its encounter movement distance, and then
attack, if any opponent is in range, when its Initiative number
comes up. After attacking, a character or creature may not move
again until the next round.

Opponents more than 5' apart may move freely, but once two
opposing figures are within 5' of each other, they are
“engaged” and must abide by the rules under Defensive
Movement, below.

Running

Characters may choose to run; a running character is not
normally allowed to attack (but see Charging, below). Running
characters can move at double their normal encounter movement
rate. Characters are allowed to run a number of rounds equal to
2 times the character's Constitution, after which they are
exhausted and may only walk (at the normal encounter rate). For
monsters not having a given Constitution, allow the monster to
run for 24 rounds. Exhausted characters or creatures must rest
for at least a turn before running again.

Maneuverability

The following rules may be considered optional. They are hardly
needed for most dungeon adventures, but will add measurably to
combat situations in the wilderness, especially in waterborne
combat situations or when some or all combatants are flying.

Characters, creatures, and vehicles of various sorts have a
turning distance. This is given as a distance in feet in
parentheses after their movement rate, and it determines how
far they must move between facing changes when moving about in
combat.

All normal player characters, and in fact most moderately sized
creatures which walk on the ground, have a turning distance of
5'. If no turning distance is given for a creature, assume that
it is 5'.

In general, a facing change is any turn of up to 90º (a
right-angle turn); on a square-gridded map, this means turning
to face directly to the right or left of the figure's current
facing. A half-turn (45º) still counts as a full facing change.
If using hexes, “diagonal” movement is not available, so a
facing change is the 60º turn to face toward the hex-side to
the right or left of the current facing.

There are a few exceptions to this rule:

First, any creature that does not move away from its starting
position during the combat round may make as many facing
changes as desired (though circumstances, such as trying to
turn a horse around in a narrow corridor, may prevent this).

Incorporeal flying creatures, such as spectres, can turn freely
at any point while moving.

Creatures which are running (moving at double speed) may not
make facing changes of more than 60º, and their turning
distance increases by 10' (or, if it is 5' normally, it
increases to 10').

Also, most creatures can shift one space laterally while
preserving their facing (this is called “sidestepping”), but
this may only be done when moving at normal (“walking”) speed,
not at fast (“running”) speed. “One space” means either 5' or
10', depending on the map or board being used.

Climbing and Diving

For battles involving three dimensions, each creature or vehicle
has an altitude (when flying) or depth (underwater). For air or
sea battles, at least one of the creatures or vehicles should
start at an altitude/depth of 0, and a new 0 level can be
established at any time, to simplify play, by adjusting the
altitudes of each creature or vehicle.

A winged flier can gain up to 10' of altitude after moving
forward by the distance shown for its maneuverability class,
and can dive (lose altitude in a controlled fashion) at up to
twice the normal movement rate; if the creature does not move
horizontally by at least one-third its normal speed, it will
stall, being forced to dive at maximum rate for one round.
Floating creatures or vehicles (balloons, fly spell, flying
carpets, etc.) can climb vertically without horizontal motion
up to half the normal movement rate, but such “floaters” can
only descend at the normal movement rate, unless they have lost
the ability to float entirely.

Charging

Under some circumstances, characters or creatures may be allowed
to attack after a running move. This is called a charge, and
some specific limitations apply. First, the charging character
or creature must move at least 10 feet, and may move up to
double his or her normal movement rate, as given above. The
movement must be in a more or less straight line toward the
intended target, and the path to the target must be reasonably
clear. Finally, the attacker must be using a weapon such as a
spear, lance, or pole arm which is suitable for use while
charging. Certain monsters, especially including those with
horns, are able to use natural attacks when charging. If the
attacker does not have line of sight to the opponent at the
start of the charge, that opponent can’t be charged.

The attack made after the charge is made at +2 on the attack
roll. The charging character or creature takes a -2 penalty to
Armor Class for the remainder of the round. If the attack hits,
it does double damage.

Set Weapon Against Charge: Spears, pole arms, and certain other
piercing weapons deal double damage when “set” (braced against
the ground or floor) and used against a charging creature. For
this to be done, the character or creature being charged must
have equal or better Initiative; this counts as holding an
action: both attacker and defender act on the attacker's
Initiative number and are therefore simultaneous.

Evasion and Pursuit

Sometimes a party of adventurers will want nothing more than to
avoid a group of monsters (or sometimes, it's the monsters
avoiding the adventurers). If one group is surprised, and the
other is not, the unsurprised group may be able to escape
automatically (unless something prevents them from making an
exit).

Otherwise, the characters wanting to flee begin doing so on
their Initiative numbers. The GM may easily play out the
pursuit, following along on his or her map (note that the
players can't draw maps while they run headlong through the
dungeon or wilderness area). Any time a character must pass
through a doorway, make a hard turn, etc., the GM may require a
saving throw vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added); if the
save is failed, the character has fallen at that point and
moves no further that round; he or she may stand up and make a
full move on his or her Initiative number in the next round.

If at any point the pursuers are within 5' (melee range) at the
start of a round, they may begin melee combat; the fleeing
characters will be subject to “parting shots” as described
under Defensive Movement if they continue to flee after the
pursuers close to melee range.

If the fleeing characters or creatures are ever able to get
beyond the pursuer's sight for a full round, they have evaded
pursuit… the pursuers have lost them.

Defensive Movement

Any time a character turns his or her back on an adjacent
opponent (who has a ready weapon) and begins movement, that
opponent is allowed a “parting shot” with a +2 bonus to attack,
even if that opponent has already made all attacks for the
round. Opponents with attack routines must choose one attack
mode; for instance, a tiger with a claw/claw/bite routine could
only claw once or bite once.

Alternately, the character may begin backing away (at up to half
normal walking movement) while continuing to fight (if the
opponent remains within reach, that is, follows the retreating
character). This is termed a fighting withdrawal.

How to Attack

To roll “to hit,” the attacker rolls 1d20 and adds his or her
attack bonus (AB), as shown on the Attack Bonus table, as well
as Strength bonus (if performing a melee attack) or Dexterity
bonus (if performing a missile attack) and any other
adjustments required by the situation. If the total is equal to
or greater than the opponent's Armor Class, the attack hits and
damage is rolled. A natural “1” on the die roll is always a
failure. A natural “20” is always a hit, if the opponent can be
hit at all (for example, monsters that can only be hit by silver
or magic weapons cannot be hit by normal weapons, so a natural
“20” with a normal weapon will not hit such a monster).

Attacking from Behind

Attacks made from behind an opponent usually receive a +2 attack
bonus. This does not combine with the Sneak Attack ability (see
the Thief, above).

Normal Men

A note about normal men: The NM entry in the table above is for
normal men, also known as zero level characters. These
characters represent the artisans, shopkeepers, scullery maids,
and other non-adventurer characters who will appear in the game.
All such characters are NPCs, of course. Demi-human races have
few if any zero-level characters among their numbers; the vast
majority of “normal men” are humans.

Average zero-level humans have 1d4 hit points, and usually are
not proficient with any weapons except bare hands. Green troops
(those who have not been in battle yet) are zero-level, but they
have 1d6 hit points and are allowed to use any weapon allowed to
a Fighter.

It is recommended not to waste time in detailing the ability
score or other statistics of such characters further; they are
normal, as in “average,” and so very few would have extreme
statistics. A blacksmith might be credited with a Strength
score of 13 or more, or a savant with Intelligence of 16 or
more, but in general such things need not be detailed for most
of these characters.

Monster Attack Bonus

When looking up a monster's hit dice on the Attack Bonus Table,
ignore all “plus” or “minus” values; so a monster with 3+2 hit
dice, or one with 3-1, is still treated as just 3 hit dice. The
exception is monsters with 1-1 or lower hit dice, which are
considered less than one hit die and have an attack bonus of
+0.

Melee Combat

Melee occurs after a character has closed for combat and strikes
at a monster or other foe. Melee weapons or attacks may
generally only be used against foes who are engaged with the
attacker (as described above).

Missile Fire

Missile weapons may be used to attack foes at a distance. The
distance the attacker is from his target affects the attack
roll, as shown on the Missile Weapon Ranges table in the
Characters section, above. In general, opponents within Short
range are attacked at +1 on the die, those beyond Short range
but within Medium range are attacked at +0, and those beyond
Medium but within Long range are attacked at -2. Foes beyond
Long range cannot be effectively attacked.

If a character attempts to use a missile weapon against a foe
who is within 5' of him or her (i.e. who is engaged with the
shooter), a penalty of -5 is applied to the attack roll. This
is due to the shooter dodging around to avoid the foe's
attacks. The only exception is if the attacker is behind the
target creature and undetected, or that creature is distracted
so as to not be able to attack the shooter; in these cases,
apply the usual +1 bonus (+3 total bonus if attacking from
behind).

Cover and Concealment

In certain situations, the intended target of a missile (or
melee) attack may have cover or concealment of some kind. Cover
is defined as “hard” protection such as that afforded by a thick
tree trunk or stone wall, that is, anything that will stop or
slow a missile weapon. Concealment is “soft” cover like fog or
light foliage that makes the target difficult to see but does
not affect the missile itself. Cover or concealment makes it
more difficult to strike an intended target, and thus a penalty
will be applied to the attacker's die roll depending upon how
much of the target is protected from attack. For concealment
the attack penalty should range from -1 (25% obscured) to -4
(90% obscured). For hard cover, these penalties should be
doubled.

Missile Weapon Rate of Fire

In general, missile weapons are allowed a single attack per
round, just as are melee weapons. However, crossbows are an
exception, as reloading a crossbow between shots is
time-consuming.

A light crossbow can be fired once per two rounds, and the user
may not perform any other actions (including movement) during
the “reloading” round. A heavy crossbow can be fired just once
per three rounds, again requiring the user to spend two rounds
doing nothing other than cocking and loading the weapon in
order to fire it again.

Siege engines also fire less often than ordinary weapons. The
rate of fire for such a weapon is presented as a fraction,
indicating the number of attacks per round; for example, 1/6
means one attack every six rounds.

Of course, the user of such a weapon may drop or sling the
weapon and switch to another weapon rather than reloading.
Also, it is possible (especially when defending a position) to
load more than one crossbow in advance and then switch weapons
each round until all have been fired. In a dungeon environment
this sort of strategy is unlikely, of course.

Grenade-Like Missiles

When throwing grenade-like missiles (flasks of oil, etc.), a
successful attack roll indicates a direct hit. Otherwise, the
GM will roll 1d10 and consult the diagram below to determine
where the missile hit. Treat each number as representing a 10'
square area.

Missiles That Miss

With the exception of grenade-like missiles, missile weapons
which miss the intended target are normally considered lost.
However, if the weapon is fired into a melee where allies of
the shooter are involved, and the attack misses, it may hit one
of the allied creatures. The GM should decide which allies may
be hit, and roll attacks against each until a hit is made or
all possible targets are exhausted. These attack rolls are made
with the shooter's normal attack bonus, just as if he or she
intended to attack the allied creature. However, the GM must
make these rolls, not the player.

This rule is applied to attacks made by monsters, when
appropriate. However, the GM still makes the rolls.

This rule is intentionally vague; the GM must decide when and
how to apply it based on the circumstances of the battle. It is
recommended that no more than three allies be “tried” in this
way, but the GM may make an exception as he or she sees fit.

Damage

If an attack hits, the attacker rolls damage as given for the
weapon. Melee attacks apply the Strength bonus or penalty to
the damage dice, as do thrown missile weapons such as daggers
or spears. Usually, attacks with bows or crossbows do not gain
the Strength bonus, but sling bullets or stones do.

Also, magic weapons will add their bonuses to damage (and cursed
weapons will apply their penalty). Note that, regardless of any
penalties to damage, any successful hit will do at least one
point of damage.

As explained elsewhere, a creature or character reduced to 0 hit
points is dead.

Subduing Damage

Attacks made with the “flat of the blade” for non-lethal damage
are made at a -4 attack penalty and do half damage. Most
weapons can be used this way; only those with penetration or
slashing features on all sides cannot.

If a character is reduced to zero hit points who has taken at
least some subduing damage, the character becomes unconscious
rather than dying. (Any further subduing damage is then
considered killing damage, allowing the possibility that
someone might be beaten to death.) A character knocked out in
this way, but not subsequently killed, will wake up with 1 hit
point in 1d4 turns, or can be awakened (with 1 hit point) by
someone else after 2d10 rounds.

Brawling

Sometimes a character will attack without a weapon, striking
with a fist or foot. This is called brawling. Normal characters
do 1d3 points of subduing damage with a punch, 1d4 with a kick;
kicks are rolled at a -2 attack penalty. A character in no
armor or leather armor cannot successfully punch or kick a
character in metal armor, and in fact, if this is attempted the
damage is applied to the attacker instead of the defender. The
GM must decide which monsters can be successfully attacked this
way. All character classes may engage in brawling; there is no
“weapon” restriction in this case.

Wrestling

A wrestling attack requires a successful melee attack roll,
where success indicates the attacker has grabbed his or her
opponent. This hold is maintained until the attacker releases
it or the defender makes a save vs. Death Ray, which is
attempted at the defender's next action (according to
Initiative). A successful wrestling attack causes the attacker
to move into the same “space” as the defender (if miniature
figures are used).

After achieving a hold on an opponent, the attacker can
automatically inflict unarmed damage (as if striking with a
fist), prevent a held opponent from speaking, use simple magic
items such as rings, or take any other action the GM allows.
The attacker may also attempt to acquire an item the opponent
is holding (such as a weapon) or attempt to move the opponent
(as described below). A held character may be voluntarily
released whenever the attacker so desires.

The attacker can’t draw or use a weapon or use a wand, staff,
scroll or potion, escape another’s wrestling attack, cast a
spell, or pin another character while holding an opponent.

Moving the Opponent: The attacker can move up to one-half speed
(bringing the defender along) with a successful attack roll, if
the attacker is strong enough to carry or drag the defender.

Acquiring an Object: The attacker may attempt to take an item
away from the defender. This requires an additional attack
roll; if the roll fails, the defender may immediately attempt
an attack roll (even if he or she has already attacked this
round) which, if successful, results in the defender pinning
the attacker; or, the defender may choose to escape instead of
reversing the hold.

Actions Allowed to the Defender: The target of a successful hold
is usually immobile (but not helpless) at least until his or her
next action, as determined by Initiative. Such characters suffer
a penalty of -4 to AC against opponents other than the attacker.

If the defender is significantly stronger and/or larger than the
attacker, he or she may move at up to one-half speed, dragging
the attacker along.

On the defender's next action, he or she can try to escape the
pin with a saving throw vs. Death Ray; the defender must apply
the better of his or her Strength or Dexterity bonuses (or
penalties) on this roll. If the escape roll succeeds, the
defender finishes the action by moving into any space adjacent
to the attacker.

If more than one attacker has a hold on a particular defender, a
successful escape roll frees the defender from just one of those
attackers.

Held characters may also use simple magic items such as rings. A
character being held may not normally cast a spell, even if he
or she has not been silenced by the attacker.

Multiple Opponents: Several combatants can be involved in a
wrestling match. Up to four combatants can wrestle a single
opponent of normal size in a given round. Creatures that are
smaller than the attacker count for half, while creatures that
are larger count at least double (as determined by the GM).
Note that, after an opponent is pinned, other attackers benefit
from the -4 AC penalty applied to the defender. However, this AC
penalty is not cumulative (that is, each successful attack does
not lower the defender's AC further).

It is also possible for another character to attack the attacker
in an ongoing wrestling bout. In this case, a successful hold on
the attacker grants the original defender a +4 bonus on
subsequent escape rolls.

Wrestling With Monsters: In general, the rules above can be used
not only when character races wrestle but also when humanoid
monsters are involved. The GM will decide whether or not to
allow wrestling involving non-humanoid creatures on a
case-by-case basis; if this is allowed, the following
adjustments apply:

Creatures with extra grasping appendages (more than the usual
two) gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls or saving throws for each
such appendage. This includes creatures with feet capable of
grasping (such as monkeys or apes, giant spiders, etc.)

Large creatures able to fly may attempt to carry off their
opponents (even if the flying creature is the defender).

Wrestling attacks against creatures with touch attacks (such as
wights) will cause the attacker to suffer one such attack
automatically every round.

Oil

A flask of oil can be used as a grenade-like missile. The oil
must be set afire in order to inflict damage; otherwise the oil
is just slippery. Assuming some means of igniting the oil is at
hand, a direct hit to a creature deals 1d8 points of fire
damage, plus in the next round the target takes an additional
1d8 points of damage, unless he or she spends the round
extinguishing the flames by some reasonable means. The GM must
judge the method used; rolling on the floor (assuming it's not
oily also) or covering the flames with a wet blanket are good
methods, for instance, while pouring or splashing water on
burning oil does little good. In any event, a flask of burning
oil only causes damage for two rounds at most.

If the oil is ignited by some sort of wick or fuse, then all
other creatures within 5 feet of the point of impact receive
1d6 points of fire damage from the splash. A save vs. Death Ray
is allowed to avoid this damage. If the flask does not hit the
intended target (as described under Grenade-Like Missiles,
above), then that creature may still take damage from the
splash, and receives a saving throw. No saving throw is allowed
for a creature which has received a direct hit.

A flask of oil spilled or splattered on the ground will burn for
10 rounds. Those attempting to cross the burning oil will
receive 1d6 points of fire damage each round they are in it
(with no saving throw in this case).

Fire-resistant creatures, including creatures having fire-based
abilities, are not damaged by burning oil.

Holy Water

Holy water damages undead creatures. A flask of holy water can
be thrown as a grenade-like missile; the flask breaks if thrown
against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against
an incorporeal creature, it must be opened and poured out onto
the target, generally requiring the attacker to be adjacent to
the target.

A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 1d8 points of damage
to an undead creature. In addition, each such creature within 5
feet of the point of impact receives 1d6 points of damage from
the splash. Holy water is only effective for one round.

Morale

NPCs and monsters don't always fight to the death; in fact, most
will try to avoid death whenever possible. Each monster listing
includes the monster's Morale score, a figure between 2 and 12.
To make a Morale check, roll 2d6; if the roll is equal to or
less than the Morale score, the monster or monsters are willing
to stand and fight. If the roll is higher than the score, the
monster has lost its nerve. Monsters with a Morale score of 12
never fail a Morale check; they always fight to the death.

In general, Morale is checked when monster(s) first encounter
opposition, and again when the monster party is reduced to half
strength (by numbers if more than one monster, or by hit points
if the monster is alone). For this purpose, monsters
incapacitated by sleep, charm, or hold magic are counted as if
dead.

The Game Master may apply adjustments to a monster's Morale
score in some situations, at his or her discretion. Generally,
adjustments should not total more than +2 or -2. No adjustment
is ever applied to a Morale score of 12.

A monster that fails a Morale check will generally attempt to
flee; intelligent monsters or NPCs may attempt to surrender, if
the GM so desires.

Note that special rules apply to retainers; see the relevant
rules in the Adventure section, above.

Turning the Undead

Clerics can Turn the undead, that is, drive away undead monsters
by means of faith alone. The Cleric brandishes his or her holy
symbol and calls upon the power of his or her divine patron.
The player rolls 1d20 and tells the GM the result. Note that
the player should always roll, even if the GM knows the
character can't succeed (or can't fail), as telling the player
whether or not to roll may reveal too much.

The GM looks up the Cleric's level on the Clerics vs. Undead
table, and cross-references it with the undead type or Hit
Dice. (The Hit Dice row is provided for use with undead
monsters not found in the Core Rules; only use the Hit Dice row
if the specific type of undead monster is not on the table and
no guidance is given in the monster's description.) If the
table indicates “No” for that combination, it is not possible
for the Cleric to affect that type of undead monster. If the
table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20
to Turn that sort of undead. If the table says “T” for that
combination, that type of undead is automatically affected (no
roll needed). If the result shown is a “D,” then that sort of
undead will be Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than
merely Turned.

If the roll is a success, 2d6 hit dice of undead monsters are
affected; surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are being
Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies can be
Turned), but a minimum of one creature will always be affected
if the first roll succeeds.

[-- Image: graphics14 --]If a mixed group of undead (say, a
wight and a pair of zombies) is to be Turned, the player still
rolls just once. The result is checked against the weakest sort
first (the zombies), and if they are successfully Turned, the
same result is checked against the next higher type of undead.
Likewise, the 2d6 hit dice are rolled only once. For example,
if the group described above is to be Turned by a 2nd level
Cleric, he or she would first need to have rolled a 15 or
higher to Turn the zombies. If this is a success, 2d6 are
rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 7, this would Turn both
zombies and leave a remainder of 3 hit dice of effect. Wights
are, in fact, 3 hit die monsters, so assuming the original 1d20
roll was a 20, the wight is Turned as well. Obviously, were it a
group of 3 zombies and a wight, the 2d6 roll would have to be a
total of 9 or higher to affect them all.

If a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all undead
monsters present are affected, he or she may try again in the
next round to affect those which remain. If any roll to Turn
the Undead fails, that Cleric may not attempt to Turn Undead
again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a
mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose.

Undead monsters which are Turned flee from the Cleric and his or
her party at maximum movement. If the party pursue and corner
the Turned undead, they may resume attacking the party; but if
left alone, the monsters will not return or attempt to attack
the Cleric or those near him or her for at least 2d4 turns.

Undead monsters subject to a D (Damaged) result suffer 1d8
damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and apply the same
damage to all undead monsters affected); those reduced to zero
hit points are utterly destroyed, being blasted into little
more than dust. Those surviving this damage are still Turned as
above.

Energy Drain

Sometimes characters are exposed to energy drain from undead or
evil magic. Such energy drain is manifested in the form of
“negative levels.” For each negative level a victim receives,
he or she suffers a semi-permanent loss of one hit die worth of
hit points, a penalty of -1 on all attack and saving throw
rolls (and any other roll made on 1d20), and -5% to any
percentile roll such as thief abilities. In addition, an
affected spell caster loses access to one of his or her
highest-level spell slots. The victim may or may not be allowed
a saving throw to resist the effect (depending on the specific
monster type).

If the character's hit points are reduced to zero or less by
means of energy drain, the victim is immediately slain. If the
energy drain is caused by an undead monster, the victim will
usually be transformed into that sort of undead (exact details
vary by type of monster).

Negative levels may be removed by magic, such as the restoration
spell. When a negative level is to be removed, divide the total
number of hit points lost by the number of negative levels
(rounding normally) to determine how many hit points are
restored.

For example, a character suffers three negative levels of energy
drain. The hit point losses rolled were 6, 5, and 2, for a total
of 13 points lost. The first negative level removed restores 13
/ 3 = 4.3333 hit points (which is rounded to 4 even). Now the
character has two negative levels and has lost 9 hit points.
The next time a negative level is removed, the character
recovers 9 / 2 = 4.5 hit points, which is rounded to 5 even.
Now the character has one negative level and 4 hit points lost.
Removal of the last negative level will restore the remaining 4
points.

Those who have suffered energy drain generally have a gaunt,
haggard look about them, noticeable by observant characters.

Healing and Rest

[-- Image: graphics50 --]Characters recover 1 hit point of
damage every day, provided that normal sleep is possible.
Characters who choose full bedrest regain an additional hit
point each evening.

Normal characters require 6 hours sleep out of every 24.
Subtract from this number of hours the character's Constitution
bonus; so a character with 18 Constitution needs only 3 hours
sleep per night (and a character with 3 Constitution needs 9
hours). Note that these figures are minimums; given a choice,
most characters would prefer to sleep two or more hours longer.

Characters who get less than the required amount of sleep suffer
a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws (as well as
not receiving any hit points of healing). For each additional
night where sufficient sleep is not received, the penalty
becomes one point worse. Regardless of how long the character
has gone without adequate sleep, the normal amount of sleep
will remove these penalties.

Constitution Point Losses

Any character who has lost Constitution points temporarily (such
as due to a disease) may regain them with normal rest. The rate
of recovery is one point per day, awarded each morning when the
character awakens from a normal night's sleep. If more than one
Constitution point was lost, the character must make a save vs.
Death Ray (without adjustments) to regain the final point;
failure results in a permanent loss of that point.

If a Constitution loss results in a lower bonus or penalty, the
character's maximum hit points must be reduced appropriately;
for instance, a character reduced from 16 to 15 Constitution
goes from +2 to +1, thus losing one hit point per die rolled.
If a reduction in maximum hit points reduces that figure to
less than the character's current hit points, reduce the
current hit points to the new maximum hit point figure
immediately.

When regaining Constitution, any increase that increases the
character's Constitution bonus results in the restoration of
the hit points lost due to the reduction, added to the maximum
hit point figure only. Current hit points will not be improved
in this fashion, but rather must be regained by normal healing.

Falling Damage

Characters suffer 1d6 damage per 10' fallen, up to a maximum
20d6. Fractional distances are rounded to the nearest whole
number, so that a fall of 1-4' does no damage, 5'-14' does 1d6,
etc.

Deafness and Blindness

A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel,
is surprised on 1-3 on 1d6, and suffers a -1 penalty to its
Initiative rolls. A blinded creature is surprised on 1-4 on
1d6, suffers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, a -4 penalty to
its Armor Class, and a -2 penalty to its Initiative rolls.
These effects are modified when dealing with monsters having
unusual sensory abilities; for example, bats may be affected by
deafness as if blinded instead.

These penalties are for characters or creatures recently
handicapped. Those who are normally blind or deaf may have
reduced penalties at the GM's option.

Note that the penalty for attacking an invisible opponent is the
same as the penalty for attacking blind, that is, -4 on the
attack roll.

Attacking a Vehicle

Attacks against vehicles (such as wagons or ships) are made
against Armor Class 11. Each vehicle has listed Hardness and
Hit Point values. Roll damage against the vehicle, and then
reduce that damage by the Hardness value. Any excess damage is
applied to the vehicle.

If the vehicle takes damage equal to or greater than the listed
HP on one side, it is reduced to half speed due to wheel damage
or a hull breach; if it takes this much again, it is
immobilized, and this much damage will sink a ship.

Repairing a Vehicle

Damage done to a vehicle may be restored at a rate of 1d4 hit
points per crew member per hour of labor. However, a vehicle
can only be restored to 90% of its maximum hit points by field
repairs; a damaged ship must be put into drydock and repaired
by a shipwright and his crew, while a wagon, cart or chariot
will require a wagonmaker to repair them. Costs of such repairs
are left to the Game Master to decide.

Saving Throws

Saving throws represent the ability of a character or creature
to resist or avoid special attacks, such as spells or poisons.
Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll, with a
target number based on the character's class and level; for
monsters, a comparable class and level are provided for the
purpose of determining the monster's saving throw figures. A
natural (unadjusted) roll of 1 on a saving throw is always a
failure, while a natural 20 is always a success.

The five categories of saving throw as follows: Death Ray or
Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, Dragon Breath, and
Spells. Spells and monster special attacks will indicate which
category applies (when a saving throw is allowed), but in some
unusual situations the Game Master will need to choose a
category. One way to make this choice is to interpret the
categories metaphorically. For example, a GM might be writing
an adventure wherein there is a trap that pours burning oil on
the hapless adventurers. Avoiding the oil might be considered
similar to avoiding Dragon Breath. Or perhaps a stone idol
shoots beams of energy from its glaring eyes when approached.
This attack may be considered similar to a Magic Wand, or if
especially potent, a Spell. The saving throw vs. Death Ray is
often used as a "catch all" save versus many of the "ordinary"
dangers encountered in a dungeon environment.

In general, saving throw rolls are not adjusted by ability score
bonus or penalty figures. There are a few exceptions:

Poison saving throws are always adjusted by the character's
Constitution modifier.

Saving throws against illusions (such as phantasmal force) are
always adjusted by the character's Intelligence modifier.

Saving throws against charm spells (and other forms of mind
control) are adjusted by the character's Wisdom modifier.

The GM may decide on other saving throw adjustments as he or she
sees fit.

Item Saving Throws

Area effects (such as fireball or lightning bolt spells) may
damage items carried by a character as well as injuring the
character. For simplicity, assume that items carried are
unaffected if the character or creature carrying them makes his
or her own saving throw. However, very fragile items (paper vs.
fire, glass vs. physical impact, etc.) may still be considered
subject to damage even if the bearer makes his or her save.

In any case where one or more items may be subject to damage,
use the saving throw roll of the bearer to determine if the
item is damaged or not. For example, a character holding an
open spellbook is struck by a fireball spell; he or she must
save vs. Spells, and then save again at the same odds for the
spellbook.

The GM should feel free to amend this rule as he or she wishes;
for instance, a backpack full of fragile items might be given a
single saving throw rather than laboriously rolling for each and
every item.

PART 6: MONSTERS

Name: The first thing given for each monster is its name (or its
most common name, if the monster is known by more than one). If
an asterisk appears after the monster's name, it indicates that
the monster is only able to be hit by special weapons (such as
silver or magical weapons, or creatures affected only by fire,
etc.) which makes the monster harder to defeat.

Armor Class: This line gives the creature’s AC for normal
combat. If the monster customarily wears armor, the first
listed AC value is with that armor, and the second, in
parentheses, is unarmored. Some monsters are only able to be
hit (damaged) by silver or magical weapons; these are indicated
either in words or with a dagger †; some monsters may only be
hit with magical weapons, indicated by a double dagger ‡.

Hit Dice: This line gives the creature’s number of hit dice, and
lists any bonus hit points. Monsters always roll eight sided
dice (d8) for hit points, unless otherwise noted. So for
example a creature with 3+2 hit dice rolls 3d8 and adds 2
points to the total.

One or two asterisks (*) may appear after the hit dice figure;
where present, they indicate a Special Ability Bonus to
experience points (XP) awarded for the monster. See Character
Advancement in the Adventure section for more details.

If the monster's Attack Bonus is different than its number of
Hit Dice, for convenience the Attack Bonus will be listed in
parentheses after the Hit Dice figure.

Movement: This line gives the monster's movement rate, or rates
for those monsters able to move in more than one fashion. For
example, Bugbears have a normal walking movement of 30', and
this is all that is listed for them. Mermaids can only move
about in the water, and so their movement is given as Swim 40'.
Pegasi can both walk and fly, so their movement is listed as 80'
Fly 160'.

In addition, a distance may appear in parentheses after a
movement figure; this is the creature's turning distance (see
Part 5: The Encounter). If a turning distance is not listed,
assume 5'.

Attacks: The number (and sometimes type or types) of attacks the
monster can perform. For example, Goblins may attack once with a
weapon, so they are marked 1 weapon. Ghouls are marked 2 claws/1
bite as they can attack with both claws and also bite in one
round.

Damage: The damage figures caused by successful attacks by the
monster. Generally this will be defined in terms of one or more
die rolls.

No. Appearing: This is given in terms of one or more die rolls.
Monsters that only appear underground and have no lairs will
have a single die roll; those that have lairs and/or those that
can be found in the wilderness will be noted appropriately. For
example, a monster noted as “1d6, Wild 2d6, Lair 3d6” is
encountered in groups of 1d6 individuals in a dungeon setting,
2d6 individuals in the wilderness, or 3d6 individuals in a
lair.

Note that number appearing applies to combatants. Non-combatant
monsters (juveniles, and sometimes females) do not count in
this number. The text of the monster description should explain
this in detail where it matters, but the GM is always the final
arbiter.

Save As: The character class and level the monster uses for
saving throws. Most monsters save as Fighters of a level equal
to their hit dice.

Morale: The number that must be rolled equal to or less than on
2d6 for the monster to pass a Morale Check. Monsters having a
Morale of 12 never fail morale checks, and fight until
destroyed (or until they have no enemies left).

Treasure Type: This line reflects how much wealth the creature
owns. See the Treasure section for more details. In most cases,
a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no
treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent creatures that
own useful, portable treasure (such as magic items) tend to
carry and use these, leaving bulky items at home.

XP: The number of experience points awarded for defeating this
monster. In some cases, the figure will vary; for instance,
Dragons of different age categories will have different XP
values. Review the Experience Points awards table in the
Adventure section, above, to calculate the correct figure in
these cases.

For convenience, animals commonly used to carry loads and/or
characters are listed here together. Such creatures obviously
have no treasure.

Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances
without food or water. The statistics presented here are for
the dromedary, or one-humped camel, which thrives in warm
deserts. A dromedary stands about 7 feet tall at the shoulder,
with its hump rising 1 foot higher. The two-humped, or
Bactrian, camel is suited to cooler, rocky areas. It is
stockier, slower (speed given in brackets), and tougher than
the dromedary. A light load for a camel is up to 400 pounds; a
heavy load, up to 800 pounds.

Donkeys are long-eared, horselike creatures. They are surefooted
and sturdy, and can be taken into dungeons or caverns. The
statistics presented here could also describe burros. A light
load for a donkey is up to 70 pounds; a heavy load, up to 140
pounds.

Draft Horses include large breeds of working horses such as
Clydesdales. These animals are usually ready for heavy work by
age three. A light load for a draft horse is up to 350 pounds;
a heavy load, up to 700 pounds.

Riding Horses include smaller breeds of working horses such as
quarter horses and Arabians as well as wild horses. These
animals are usually ready for useful work by age two. Riding
horses cannot fight while a rider is mounted. A light load for
a riding horse is up to 250 pounds; a heavy load, up to 500
pounds.

War Horses are trained and bred for strength and aggression.
They usually are not ready for warfare before age three. A
light load for a warhorse is up to 350 pounds; a heavy load, up
to 700 pounds.

Mules are sterile crossbreeds of donkeys and horses. They can be
taken into dungeons or caverns. A mule is similar to a riding
horse, but slightly stronger and more agile. A light load for a
mule is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 600 pounds.

[-- Image: Image1 --]A Pony is a small horse, under 5 feet tall
at the shoulder. Ponies are otherwise similar to riding horses
and cannot fight while carrying a rider. Ponies can be trained
for war, and the morale in parentheses above is for a war pony;
this does not allow them to fight while carrying a rider. A
light load for a pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy load, up to
550 pounds.

Giant ants are among the hardiest and most adaptable vermin.
Soldiers and workers are about 5 to 6 feet long, while queens
can grow to a length of 9 feet. Giant ants may be red or black;
there is no statistical difference between them. Though
relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they
will fight to the death. They are known to collect shiny
things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure
in their lair.

[-- Image: graphics18 --]Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny
metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant
ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively
pure nuggets.

The assassin vine is a semi-mobile plant found in temperate
forests that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and
crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots.

Because it can lie very still indeed, an assassin vine surprises
on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of
damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an
additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter. A victim may
attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with
Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may
not attempt this and also perform an attack. The plant will
continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or
the victim manages to escape.

An assassin vine can move about, albeit very slowly, but
generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds. They have
no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and
vibration.

A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long.
Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine
about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of
leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits
that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty
but bitter flavor. Assassin vine berries make a heady wine.

A subterranean version of the assassin vine grows near hot
springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of thermal energy.
These plants have thin, wiry stems and gray leaves shot through
with silver, brown, and white veins so that they resemble
mineral deposits. An assassin vine growing underground usually
generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of
mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and
help conceal it.

A basilisk is an eight-legged reptilian monster that petrifies
living creatures with a mere gaze. A basilisk usually has a
dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly. Some specimens
sport a short, curved horn atop the nose. An adult basilisk’s
body grows to about 6 feet long, not including its tail, which
can reach an additional length of 5 to 7 feet. The creature
weighs about 300 pounds.

[-- Image: graphics44 --]Any living creature which meets the
gaze of the basilisk must save vs. Petrification or be turned
to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the
basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the
monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to
attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight
the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and
no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a
mirror it must save vs. Petrification or be turned to stone; a
petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks
instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even
drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage
to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its
reflection.

Bats are nocturnal flying mammals. The statistics presented here
describe small, insectivorous bats. They have a natural sonar
that allows them to operate in total darkness; for game
purposes, treat this ability as Darkvision.

A group of normal-sized bats has no effective attack (at least
in terms of doing damage) but can confuse those in the area,
flying around apparently randomly. For every ten bats in the
area, one creature can be confused; such a creature will suffer
a penalty of -2 on all attack and saving throw rolls while the
bats remain in the area.

[-- Image: graphics116 --]A giant bat has a wingspan of 15 feet
and weighs about 200 pounds. They have the same sensory
abilities as normal-sized bats, but being much larger, they are
able to attack adventurers; many are carnivorous, making such
attacks likely.

Bear

Bears attack by rending opponents with their claws, dragging
them in and biting them. A successful hit with both paws
indicates a hug attack for additional damage (as given for each
specific bear type). All bears are very tough to kill, and are
able to move and attack for one round after losing all hit
points.

Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and
black abdomens. They are 3 to 4 feet long. In combat, a giant
bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of it, and sprays a
cone of very hot and noxious gases from a nozzle in the
rearmost tip of the abdomen. This toxic blast causes 2d6 points
of damage to all within a cone 10' long and 10' wide at the far
end (a save vs. Death Ray for half damage is allowed). A giant
bombardier beetle can use this spray attack up to five times
per day, but no more often than once per three rounds. Faced
with opponents attacking from just one direction, a giant
bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray
attack rather than biting.

Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have more or less
the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no
penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

adventurers. They have two glands, one above each eye, that

Giant fire beetles are about 2 feet long. They are normally

Black puddings are amorphous creatures that live only to eat.
They inhabit underground areas throughout the world, scouring
caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic matter,
living or dead. They attack any creatures they encounter,
lashing out with pseudopods or simply engulfing opponents with
their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch and
digest their prey.

If attacked with normal or magical weapons, or with lightning or
electricity, a black pudding suffers no injury, but will be
split into two puddings; the GM should divide the original
black pudding's hit dice between the two however he or she sees
fit, with the limitation that neither pudding may have less than
two hit dice. A two hit die black pudding is simply unharmed by
such attacks, but cannot be split further.

Cold or ice based attacks do not harm a black pudding, but such
an attack will paralyze the pudding for one round per die of
damage the attack would normally cause. Other attack forms will
affect a black pudding normally; the preferred method of killing
one usually involves fire.

The typical black pudding measures 10 feet across and 2 feet
thick, and weighs about 10,000 pounds. Black puddings of
smaller sizes may be encountered, possibly as a result of the
splitting described above.

The blink dog is an intelligent canine that has a limited
teleportation ability; they are able to teleport up to 120' at
will. Blink dogs may teleport immediately after attacking, thus
possibly avoiding being attacked. In particular, a blink dog may
teleport next to an opponent, attack, and teleport away in the
same round; the victim would need to strike on the same
Initiative number as the blink dog in order to attack it in
melee.

Blink dogs hunt in packs, teleporting in a seemingly random
fashion until they surround their prey, allowing some of them
to get the bonus for attacking from behind.

Blink dogs are medium-sized dogs, typically light brown in color
and short haired, though other varieties are rumored to exist.
They have their own language, a mixture of barks, yaps, whines,
and growls that can transmit complex information. They are
usually shy, avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate
displacers and will generally attack them on sight.

Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually
animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings. These
plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are
normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.

The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the
plant in ideal conditions. Blood roses can move about slowly,
and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order
to achieve those ideal conditions. Living creatures who smell
the fragrance must save vs. Poison or become befuddled,
dropping anything carried and approaching the plant. Each round
such a creature or character is within the affected area, this
save must be made. Befuddled characters will not resist the
plant-creature's attacks; if affected creatures are removed
from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4
rounds later. Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not
affected.

[-- Image: graphics27 --]Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or
3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack.
When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to
drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose
which has recently (within one day) “eaten” this way will have
flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will
fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the
blood it has consumed.

Bugbears look like huge, hairy goblins, standing about 6 feet
tall. Their eyes are usually a darkish brown color and they
move very quietly. They are wild and relatively fearless, and
bully smaller humanoids whenever possible.

Bugbears prefer to ambush opponents if they can. When hunting,
they often send scouts ahead of the main group. Bugbear attacks
are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant.
They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising
opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. In order to remain silent, they must
wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor
Class scores above. Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due
to their great Strength. As with most goblinoid monsters, they
have Darkvision with a 30' range.

One out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of
4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage. In lairs of
16 or more bugbears, there will be a chieftain of 6+6 Hit Dice
(500 XP), with a +3 bonus to damage. Bugbears gain a +1 bonus
to their morale if they are led by a hardened warrior or
chieftain. In the lair, bugbears never fail a morale check as
long as the chieftain is alive. In addition, there is a 2 in 6
chance that a shaman will be present in a lair. A shaman is
equal to an ordinary bugbear statistically, but possesses 1d4+1
levels of Clerical abilities.

Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly
resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp
teeth. Caecilia live entirely underground. The giant variety
grows up to 30' long and frequently are found in caverns or
dungeons. They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very
sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their
prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.

A caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid or demi-human
(such as a goblin or halfling) whole. On a natural attack roll
of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that
roll does actually hit the victim). A swallowed victim suffers
1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with
a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger. While the
inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit,
fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to
the attack roll are applied.

Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally
attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and
digest its meal.

Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live
underground. An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long.
They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae,
vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive
“hairs” on their legs to sense the environment around them.

These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as
well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they
will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around,
or spitting nasty goo.

All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed,
attracting wandering monsters. The GM should roll a wandering
monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are
attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will
arrive in 1d4 rounds.

Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent)
will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit.
This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.

A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to
30' up. If one of these creatures is not engaged at the
beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent
creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits,
the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from
the impact.

Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its
digestive juices) up to 10' away. Each giant cave locust can
perform this attack just once per encounter. This spit attack
will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in
which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their
nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next
round. To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an
attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical
bonuses, but no normal armor value applies). If the attack
hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do
anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.

Centaurs appear to be half man, half horse, having the torso,
arms and head of a man in the position a horse's head would
otherwise occupy. A centaur is as big as a heavy horse, but
much taller and slightly heavier; average males are about 7
feet tall and weigh about 2,100 pounds, and females are just a
bit smaller. Centaurs may charge with a spear or lance just as
a man on horseback, with the same bonuses. They typically wear
leather armor when prepared for combat.

Centaurs are generally haughty and aloof, but very honorable.
Most would rather die than allow humans, demi-humans, or
humanoids to ride on their backs.

victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one
successfully hit. The gore attack may only be used against a

Displacers are blue-black, catlike monsters with strange bladed
winglike arms extending from their shoulders. The blades are
carried folded back like wings, but the Displacer swings the
blades around in front to attack.

The real power and danger of the Displacer is its power of
displacement, which causes the monster's apparent location to
shift around constantly over a range of 3' from the monster's
true location. This is a form of illusion, but a powerful form
that cannot be seen through even by those who know the secret.

[-- Image: graphics45 --]Any character fighting a Displacer for
the first time will miss his or her first strike regardless of
the die roll. Thereafter, all attacks against displacers will
be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll. This is not
cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind. Some monsters,
such as bats, do not depend on vision to fight and thus may be
able to perceive the monster's true location and fight without
penalty.

The djinn (singular djinni) are humanoid creatures from the
Elemental Plane of Air. A djinni in its natural form is about
10½ feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

[-- Image: graphics46 --]Djinn disdain physical combat,
preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities
against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes
flight and becomes a whirlwind (see below) to harass those who
follow; the 12 morale reflects a djinni's absolute control over
its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw
its life away easily. Use the “8” figure to determine whether an
outmatched djinn decides to leave a combat.

Djinn have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will
(that is, without needing magic words or gestures): create food
and drink, creating tasty and nourishing food for up to 2d6
humans or similar creatures, once per day; become invisible,
with unlimited uses per day; create normal items, creating up
to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of permanent
nature or metal goods lasting at most a day, once per day;
assume gaseous form, as the potion, up to one hour per day; and
create illusions, as the spell phantasmal force but including
sound as well as visual elements, three times per day.

Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with no limit
as to the number of times per day this power may be used; a
djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it were an air elemental.

Due to their highly magical nature, djinn cannot be harmed by
non-magical weapons. They are immune to normal cold, and suffer
only half damage from magical attacks based on either cold or
wind.

[-- Image: graphics121 --]Dopplegangers are strange beings that
are able to take on the shapes of those they encounter; they
can also read minds (as the spell, ESP, but with no limit of
duration). In its natural form, the creature looks more or less
humanoid, but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and
half-formed features. The flesh is pale and hairless. Its
large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. A
doppleganger is hardy, with a natural agility not in keeping
with its frail appearance. In its natural form a doppleganger
is about 5½ feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.

Dopplegangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to
stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society.
Although not usually evil, they are interested only in
themselves and regard all others as playthings to be
manipulated and deceived.

When in its natural form, a doppleganger strikes with its
powerful fists. In the shape of a warrior or some other armed
person, it attacks with whatever weapon is appropriate. In such
cases, it uses its mind reading power to employ the same tactics
and strategies as the person it is impersonating.

Dragon

[-- Image: Image6 --]Dragons are large (sometimes very large)
winged reptilian monsters. Unlike wyverns, dragons have four
legs as well as two wings; this is how experts distinguish
“true” dragons from other large reptilian monsters. All
dragons are long-lived, and they grow slowly for as long as
they live. For this reason, they are described as having seven
“age categories,” ranging from 3 less to 3 more hit dice than
the average. For convenience, a table is provided following the
description of each dragon type; this table shows the variation
in hit dice, damage from their various attacks, and other
features peculiar to dragons.

If one dragon is encountered, it is equally likely to be a male
or female ranging from -2 to +3 hit dice (1d6-3); two are a
mated pair ranging from -1 to +2 hit dice (1d4-2). If three or
four are encountered, they consist of a mated pair plus one or
two young of -3 hit dice in size. If this is the case, the
parents receive a Morale of 12 in combat since they are
protecting their young.

A dragon attacks with its powerful claws and bite, its long,
whiplike tail, and most famously with its breath weapon. It
prefers to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has
worn down the enemy with the breath weapon (or possibly with
spells, if the dragon can cast any). Older, more intelligent
dragons are adept at sizing up the opposition and eliminating
the most dangerous foes first (or avoiding them while picking
off weaker enemies).

Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times per day as
it has hit dice, except that dragons of the lowest age category
do not yet have a breath weapon. The breath may be used no more
often than every other round, and the dragon may use its claws
and tail at the same time. The tail swipe attack may only be
used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while the claws
may be used only on those opponents in front of the creature.
Due to their serpentine necks, dragons may bite in any
direction, even behind them.

The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of damage per hit
die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8 points of damage with its
breath). Victims may make a save vs. Dragon Breath for half
damage. The breath weapon may be projected in any direction
around the dragon, even behind, for the same reason that the
dragon can bite those behind it.

There are three shapes (or areas of effect) which a dragon's
breath weapon can cover. Each variety has a “normal” shape,
which that type of dragon can use from the second age category
(-2 hit dice) onward. Upon reaching the sixth age category (+2
hit dice), a dragon learns to shape its breath weapon into one
of the other shapes (GM's option); at the seventh age category
(+3 hit dice), the dragon is competent at producing all three
shapes.

The shapes are:

Cone Shaped: The breath weapon begins at the dragon's mouth, and
is about 2' wide at that point; it extends up to the maximum
length (based on the dragon type and age) and is the maximum
width at that point (again, as given for the dragon's type and
age).

Line Shaped: The breath weapon is 5' wide and extends the given
length in a straight line.

Cloud Shaped: The breath weapon covers an area up to the maximum
given width (based on the dragon type and age) in both length
and width (that is, the length figure given for the dragon type
and age is ignored). A cloud-shaped breath weapon is, at most,
20' deep or high.

All dragons save for those of the lowest age category are able
to speak Dragon. Each type has a given chance of “talking;”
this is the chance that the dragon will know Common or a
demi-human or humanoid language. Many who talk choose to learn
Elvish. If the first roll for “talking” is successful, the GM
may roll again, with each additional roll adding another
language which the dragon may speak.

Some dragons learn to cast spells; the odds that a dragon can
cast spells are the same as the odds that a dragon will learn
to speak to lesser creatures, but each is rolled for
separately.

[-- Image: graphics58 --]Although goals and ideals vary among
varieties, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth,
collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels,
and magic items as possible. Those with large hoards are loath
to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to
patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons, there is
no such thing as enough treasure. It’s pleasing to look at, and
they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their
hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. Note
that, for most monsters, the Treasure Type given is for a lair
of average numbers; for dragons, the Treasure Type is for a
single individual of average age. Note also that mated pairs do
not share treasure! Rather than adjusting the treasure amounts
for the number of monsters, adjust for the age of the dragon; a
dragon of the highest age category would have about double the
given amount, while one of the next to lowest age category
would have perhaps a tenth that amount (hatchlings have no
treasure).

Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their
surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps
and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground;
trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability.
When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight,
so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.
Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still
motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect
valuable items.

Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part
of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey
comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this
case).

Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon
may hold its breath up to three turns while lying in wait
underwater.

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually flying
in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some nearly match
the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their
advantage. Their vibrant color makes blue dragons easy to spot
in barren desert surroundings. However, they often burrow into
the sand so only part of their heads are exposed, waiting until
opponents come within 100 feet to spring out and attack
(surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case).

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also
store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks
valuable, they are most fond of gems, especially sapphires. Blue
dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons.
They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering
their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and
killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon
will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with
that person as a cat plays with a mouse.

Blue dragons are immune to normal lightning, and suffer only
half damage from magical lightning.

Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. Those having
spellcasting ability make heavy use of spells in combat. Among
their favorites are cloudkill, sleep, and slow.

All gold dragons have the power to assume human form at will (in
a manner equivalent to the spell polymorph self, but performed
at will).

Unlike many other dragons, gold dragons are not cruel and do not
seek to kill for pleasure. Many tales are told of gold dragons
offering assistance to adventurers. They are, however, every
bit as avaricious as any dragon; adventurers in need of gold
need not bother asking for a loan.

Gold dragons are immune to all poisons, as well as normal fire.
They suffer only half damage from magical fire.

Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation,
picking on creatures of any size. If the target is intriguing
or seems formidable, the dragon stalks the creature to
determine the best time to strike and the most appropriate
tactics to use. If the target appears weak, the dragon makes
its presence known quickly – it enjoys evoking terror.

Green dragons especially like to question adventurers to learn
more about their society and abilities, what is going on in the
countryside, and if there is treasure nearby. Adventurers may be
allowed to live so long as they remain interesting… but woe to
them when the dragon becomes bored.

Green dragons are immune to all poisons. Note that, despite
their breath weapon being described as "poison gas," damage
done by it is exactly the same as with other dragons. More
specifically, those in the area of effect do not have to "save
or die" as with ordinary poison, but rather save vs. Breath
Weapon for half damage.

Because red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to
appraise an adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap
decision whether to attack, using one of many strategies worked
out ahead of time. A red dragon lands to attack small, weak
creatures with its claws and bite rather than obliterating them
with its breath weapon, so as not to destroy any treasure they
might be carrying.

Red dragons are cruel monsters, actively seeking to hunt,
torment, kill and consume intelligent creatures. They are often
said to prefer women and elves, but in truth a red dragon will
attack almost any creature less powerful than itself.

Red dragons are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half
damage from magical fire.

Though they live in the water and are somewhat adapted to it,
Sea Dragons still must breathe air, similar to dolphins or
whales. A Sea Dragon may hold its breath up to three turns
while swimming or performing other moderate activity.

These dragons have much the same physical structure as other
dragons, but their feet are webbed and their tails are short,
flat and broad; these adaptations help the sea dragon swim
efficiently, but severely limit their ability to walk on dry
land. Unlike other dragons, sea dragons do not have a tail
attack. The breath weapon of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam;
they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the
breath weapon of another sea dragon), and suffer only half
damage from magical steam attacks.

Young sea dragons are light bluish-gray in color (similar to
dolphins), darkening to a deep slate color in older
individuals.

Sea dragons are neutral in outlook, in much the same way as
white dragons. They often maintain lairs in air-filled undersea
caverns.

White Dragons prefer to live in cold regions, whether in the
highest mountains or in the cold northern lands. They are the
least intelligent of dragons, though this does not mean that
they are stupid by any stretch of the imagination. They are
motivated completely by a drive to live, to reproduce, and (of
course) to accumulate treasure; they kill to live, not for
pleasure.

White dragons prefer sudden assaults, swooping down from aloft
or bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. Typically, a
white dragon begins with its icy breath weapon, then tries to
eliminate a single opponent with a follow-up attack.

White dragons are immune to normal cold, and take only half
damage from magical cold or ice.

A dragon turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color
as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights
that line the shell resemble light dancing on open water. The
turtle’s legs, tail, and head are a lighter green, flecked with
golden highlights. An adult dragon turtle can measure from 100
to 200 feet from snout to tail. They are occasionally mistaken
for rocky outcroppings or even small islands.

Dragon turtles are fierce fighters and generally attack any
creature that threatens their territory or looks like a
potential meal. Though they are not true dragons, they do
advance through the same sort of age categories as the true
dragons do; however, each age category changes the dragon
turtle's Hit Dice by 5.

[-- Image: graphics112 --]Due to their massive size, dragon
turtles are immune to virtually all poisons.

[-- Image: graphics47 --]Dryads are female nature spirits; each
is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must
never stray more than 300 yards from it. Any who do become ill
and die within 4d6 hours. A dryad’s oak does not radiate magic.
A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies;
likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.

A dryad’s delicate features are much like a female elf's, though
her flesh is like bark or fine wood, and her hair is like a
canopy of leaves that changes color with the seasons. Although
they are generally solitary, up to seven dryads have been
encountered in one place on rare occasions.

Shy, intelligent, and resolute, dryads are as elusive as they
are alluring -- they avoid physical combat and are rarely seen
unless they wish to be. If threatened, or in need of an ally, a
dryad can charm (as the spell charm person), attempting to gain
control of the attacker(s) who could help the most against the
rest. Any attack on her tree, however, provokes the dryad into
a frenzied defense.

[-- Image: graphics118 --]A typical giant eagle stands about 10
feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles its
smaller cousins in nearly every way except size. It weighs
about 500 pounds. Many giant eagles are intelligent creatures
and speak Common.

A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving
earthward at tremendous speed. When it cannot dive, it uses its
powerful talons and slashing beak to strike at its target’s head
and eyes.

A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the
vicinity of its nest and generally ignores creatures that do not
appear threatening. A mated pair attacks in concert, making
repeated diving attacks to drive away intruders, and fights to
the death to defend their nest or hatchlings.

The efreet (singular efreeti) are humanoid creatures from the
Elemental Plane of Fire. An efreeti in its natural form stands
about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet are
malicious by nature. They love to mislead, befuddle, and
confuse their foes. They do this for enjoyment as much as for
tactical reasons.

Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute control
over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will
throw its life away easily. Use the “9” figure to determine
whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.

Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at
will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become
invisible, with unlimited uses per day; assume gaseous form, as
the potion, up to one hour per day; create illusions, as the
spell phantasmal force but including sound as well as visual
elements, three times per day; create flame, with unlimited
uses; and create a wall of fire (as the spell), once per day.
Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in
its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as
desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torchflame or as
small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any
ordinary flame does. The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a
range of up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful
hit. The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well
if desired, once per round.

Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no
limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used;
an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.

[-- Image: graphics29 --]Due to their highly magical nature,
efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons. They are immune
to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire
attacks.

Elemental*

Elementals are incarnations of the elements that compose
existence.

It is possible to summon an elemental by one of three means: By
the use of a staff, or of a device, or by casting a spell. For
each elemental type, separate statistics are provided for each
of these three categories.

Due to their highly magical nature, elementals cannot be harmed
by non-magical weapons.

[-- Image: graphics90 --]Air elementals resemble “dust devils,”
that is, small whirlwinds, but they are much more powerful. Air
elementals take double damage when attacked by earth-based
attacks (including by earth elementals). An air elemental may
choose either to attack a single opponent, thus receiving one
attack per round at the listed damage, or may choose to knock
all opponents in a 5' radius to the ground; if the latter
attack is used, all creatures of 2 hit dice or less must save
vs. Death Ray or fall prone. Creatures of 3 or more levels or
hit dice are not so affected. Air elementals do an additional

Fire elementals are simply flames, which may appear generally
humanoid for brief moments when they attack. Fire elementals
take double damage when attacked by water (including water
elementals). They cannot cross a body of water wider than their
own diameter. They do an additional 1d8 points of damage against
creatures which are cold or icy in nature.

[-- Image: graphics92 --]Remember that a fire elemental is
constantly burning; such a creature may easily start fires if
it moves into an area containing items which burn easily, such
as dry wood, paper, or oil. No specific rules are given for
such fires, but the GM is directed to the rules for burning oil
for an example of fire damage.

Massive herbivores of tropical lands, elephants are
unpredictable creatures but nevertheless are sometimes used as
mounts or beasts of burden. This entry describes an African
elephant. Indian elephants are slightly smaller and weaker, but
more readily trained.

A light load for an African elephant is 7,500 pounds; a heavy
load, up to 15,000 pounds. For an Indian elephant, a light load
is up to 7,000 pounds, and a heavy load up to 14,000 pounds.

An elephant has no treasure as such, but the tusks of an
elephant are worth 1d8 x 100 gp.

Barracuda are predatory fish found in salt water. Huge
barracudas are about 12' long, while giant specimens can exceed
20'. They have elongated bodies, pointed heads and prominent
jaws. Their bodies are covered with smooth scales, typically
blue, gray or silver in color. They have extremely keen
eyesight and are surprised only on a 1 on 1d6. Due to the
quickness of their attack, barracudas are themselves capable of
surprising on 1-3 on 1d6 and gain a +2 bonus to Initiative.

Giant barracudas always appear singly and are 50% likely to
break off the attack after 1d4 rounds if they haven't killed
their prey. Both kinds are attracted to shiny objects.

Giant bass are generally between 10' and 25' long. Most are
greenish-grey, marked with dark lateral stripes, though some
are almost completely black. They are generally found in lakes
or rivers, as they are not adapted for salt water.

Giant bass are predatory, and on a natural attack roll of 20 a
giant bass will swallow whole a dwarf-sized or smaller
creature, which then takes 2d4 damage per round until it is
dead. Swallowed characters can attack only with daggers or
similar short weapons. Note that each giant bass can swallow at
most one character, and a giant bass which has swallowed a
character will attempt to retreat (having achieved its goal).

Giant catfish fins are edged with a natural poison that causes a
painful burning sensation for 3d10 rounds if a save vs. Poison
is failed. The pain causes the affected character or creature
to suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws;
further poisonings will increase this penalty by -1 each, down
to a maximum penalty of -5 as well as adding 6 rounds to the
duration of the poison effect.

Because of its large size (15 to 20 feet long) and body design,
a giant catfish cannot target more than one of its attacks on
any single creature; that is, it cannot bite and fin the same
opponent, nor use both fins on one victim.

Giant frogs are enlarged versions of the common frog; most
resemble bullfrogs in appearance, but an adult giant frog is 3'
long and weighs about 250 pounds. They are predators, but will
normally only attack creatures smaller than themselves. Giant
toads are statistically just like giant frogs; however, they
are often found in “drier” areas as they do not have to
maintain a wet skin surface.

[-- Image: graphics28 --]A giant frog can stretch its tongue out
up to 15' and drag up to dwarf-sized prey to its mouth; on every
subsequent round, the victim is hit automatically. On a natural
20 attack roll, the victim is swallowed whole, taking 1d6
damage per round thereafter. Each giant frog can swallow only
one such victim.

Gargoyles are demonic-looking winged humanoid monsters with gray
stone-like skin. They are often mistaken for winged stone
statues, for they can remain still indefinitely without moving.
Gargoyles use this disguise to ambush their foes, surprising on
1-4 on 1d6 if their foes do not otherwise suspect them. They
are cruel monsters, inflicting pain on other creatures for the
sole purpose of enjoyment.

[-- Image: Image16 --]Gargoyles require no food, water, or air.

magical weapons.

The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along
dungeon corridors and cave floors, absorbing carrion,
creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains trapped and
visible inside the cube’s body. A typical gelatinous cube is
ten feet on a side and weighs about 15,000 pounds; however,
smaller specimens have been reported.

A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It
is capable of lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs
foes. Any character hit by a gelatinous cube must save vs.
Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d4 turns.

Any treasure indicated will be visible inside the creature,
which must be slain if the treasure is to be recovered.

Although these creatures look just like their lesser kin, the
ghoul, they are far more deadly and cunning. Those hit by a
ghast’s bite or claw attack must save vs. Paralyzation or be
paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to this paralysis.
Ghasts try to attack with surprise whenever possible, striking
from behind tombstones and bursting from shallow graves; when
these methods are employed, they are able to surprise opponents
on 1-3 on 1d6. They are undead, and thus are immune to sleep,
charm and hold magics. They may be Turned by Clerics using the
same column as the ghoul. As they are superior to ghouls, in a
mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GM should apply Turning
effects to the ordinary ghouls first.

Humanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghast fever.
Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10% chance of the
infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to
save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies
within a day.

An afflicted humanoid who dies of ghast fever rises as a ghast
at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghast in this
way retains none of the knowledge or abilities he or she
possessed in life. The newly-risen ghast is not under the
control of any other ghasts, but hungers for the flesh of the
living and behaves like any other ghast in all respects.

The stink of death and corruption surrounding these creatures is
overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a
save vs. Poison or be sickened for 2d6 rounds (-2 to attack
rolls). A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
again by the same ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A neutralize
poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature.

[-- Image: graphics37 --]Ghosts are the spectral remnants of
intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest
easily in their graves. A ghost normally resembles the form it
had in life, but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For
instance, the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evil
might look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal, ghosts
may be hit only by magical weapons.

Seeing a ghost is so terrible that the victim must save vs.
Spells or flee for 2d6 rounds. A character or creature who
successfully saves vs. a given ghost's fear attack may not be
so affected by that ghost again, but of course may still be
affected by another.

A ghost that hits a living target with its touch attack does 1d8
points of damage, and at the same time regenerates the same
number of hit points. In addition, the victim loses 1
Constitution point. Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived
creatures such as dragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death
Ray to resist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit.
Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. If a
ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have a
Constitution score, the GM should assign whatever score he or
she sees fit.

Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one point per
casting of restoration; nothing else (except a wish) can
restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character's
Constitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently and cannot
be raised (but still may be reincarnated).

Once per turn, a ghost can use telekinesis (as the spell) as if
it were a 10th level Magic-User.

Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess a living
creature. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (as if
cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it does not
require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be
able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrun it).
The target can resist the attack with a successful save vs.
Spells. A creature that successfully saves is immune to being
possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the save fails, the
ghost enters the target's body and controls it; control may be
maintained until the ghost chooses to leave the victim's body,
or until it is driven out by means of a remove curse spell.
While it is possessing a living creature, a ghost may not use
any of its special abilities.

Ghouls are undead monsters which eat the flesh of dead humanoids
to survive. They are vile, disgusting carrion-eaters, but are
more than willing to kill for food. Those slain by ghouls will
generally be stored until they begin to rot before the ghouls
will actually eat them.

Those hit by a ghoul’s bite or claw attack must save vs.
Paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2d8 turns. Elves are immune to
this paralysis. Ghouls try to attack with surprise whenever
possible, striking from behind tombstones and bursting from
shallow graves; when these methods are employed, they are able
to surprise opponents on 1-3 on 1d6. Like all undead, they may
be Turned by Clerics and are immune to sleep, charm and hold
magics.

Humanoids bitten by ghouls may be infected with ghoul fever.
Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 5% chance of the
infection being passed. The afflicted humanoid is allowed to
save vs. Death Ray; if the save is failed, the humanoid dies

Cloud giants’ skin ranges in color from milky white to light sky
blue. They have hair of silvery white or brass, and their eyes
are iridescent blue. Adult males are about 18 feet tall and
weigh about 5,000 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and
lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old.

Cloud giants dress in the finest clothing available and wear
jewelry. To many, appearance indicates station: The better the
clothes and the finer the jewelry, the more important the
wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one or
more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Like most giants,
they are suspicious of the smaller races, but cloud giants do
not usually prey upon them, preferring instead to demand
tribute from humans, demi-humans, or humanoids living nearby.

[-- Image: graphics69 --]Cloud giants fight in well-organized
units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to
fight from a position above their opponents. Cloud giants can
throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6 points of damage each.
Also, 5% of cloud giants have the abilities of a Magic-User of
level 2 to 8 (2d4). A favorite tactic is to circle the enemies,
barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical
abilities confound them with spells. In battle, cloud giants
wear finely crafted, intricately engraved plate mail.

Frost giants are, first and foremost, cunning. They dislike the

outright they will try to use their advantages to convince
those weaker than them to submit. If faced with a stronger

by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. They
live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about
the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land
or gathering food.

[-- Image: graphics68 --]Storm giants prefer to attack first
with their lightning bolts (which work just as the spell does,
and can be used once per five rounds; a save vs. Spells reduces
damage to half). Also, 10% of storm giants have the abilities of
a Magic-User of level 2 to 12 (2d6). In battle, they wear
well-crafted and well-cared-for plate mail.

Unlike most other giants, storm giants have been known to
befriend humans, elves, or dwarves.

[-- Image: graphics31 --]Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids
that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or
reddish-brown fur. An adult male gnoll is about 7½ feet tall
and weighs 300 pounds.

Gnolls are nocturnal, and have Darkvision with a 30' range. They
are cruel carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food
because they scream more. They show little discipline when
fighting unless they have a strong leader.

One out of every six gnolls will be a hardened warrior of 4 Hit
Dice (240 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength.
Gnolls gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by such
a warrior. In lairs of 12 or greater, there will be a pack
leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) having a +2 bonus to damage. In
the lair, gnolls never fail a morale check as long as the pack
leader is alive. In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2
on 1d6 of a shaman being present, and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or
warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hardened warrior
statistically, and in addition has Clerical abilities at level
1d4+1. A witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular gnoll, and
has Magic-User abilities of level 1d4.

Gnomes stand 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their
skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is
fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Males usually
wear short, carefully trimmed beards.

Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they
decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine
jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live
about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30' range. When
attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes
gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their
preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very
effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20%
chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are
successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their
foes on 1-4 on 1d6.

Gnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the
language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome
lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in
gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in
the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile.
They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races.
When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will
generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount
of treasure.

[-- Image: graphics38 --]Most gnomes encountered outside their
home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the
lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three
civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes
have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be
a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to
their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and
sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one
out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice
(360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In
addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king
of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate
mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to
strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check
as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on
1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2
on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and

Goblins are small, wicked humanoids that favor ambushes,
overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they can
devise. An adult goblin stands 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40
to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking,
varying in color from red to yellow. A goblin’s skin color
ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red;
usually all members of a single tribe are about the same color.
Goblins wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward drab,
soiled-looking colors. They have Darkvision with a 30' range.

The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather
armor with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30'
and a natural Armor Class of 11.

Some goblins ride dire wolves into combat, and large groups of
goblins will often employ them to track and attack their foes.

[-- Image: graphics105 --]One out of every eight goblins will be
a warrior of 3-3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Goblins gain a +1 bonus to
their morale if they are led by a warrior. In a lair or other
settlement, one out of every fifteen will be a chieftain of 5-5
Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11)
and movement of 10' that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to
strength. In lairs or settlements of 30 or more goblins, there
will be a goblin king of 7-7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor
Class of 16 (11), wearing chainmail and carrying a shield, with
a movement of 10', and having a +1 bonus to damage. Goblins have
a +2 bonus to morale while their king is present (this is not
cumulative with the bonus given by a warrior leader). In
addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman
being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a goblin king is present). A
shaman is equivalent to a regular goblin statistically, but has
Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

Golem*

Golems are magically created automatons of great power.
Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and
elemental forces. The animating force for a golem is an
elemental spirit. The process of creating the golem binds the
spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of
the golem’s creator.

Being mindless, golems generally do nothing without orders from
their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are
incapable of any strategy or tactics. A golem’s creator can
command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear
its creator. If not actively commanded, a golem usually follows
its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if
attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem
a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence.
The golem’s creator can order the golem to obey the commands of
another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone
else’s control, and so on), but the golem’s creator can always
resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to
obey him alone.

Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects,
except when otherwise noted. They can only be hit by magical
weapons.

great cats. They are able to detect invisible creatures or
objects within 60', and can track with 95% accuracy through any

damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 full points of damage

Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created from the
skeletons of at least two dead humanoids. Though made of bone,
they are not undead and cannot be turned.

Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem can be armed
with two two-handed weapons, giving 2 attacks per round and a
damage figure of 1d10/1d10 or by weapon.

When a bone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance
each round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem
goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage,
attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object
smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving
on to spread more destruction. The golem’s creator, if within 60
feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and
persuasively to the golem; he or she must make a save vs.
Spells to succeed at this, and at least 1 round of time is

golem to reset the golem’s berserk chance to 0%.

These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike natural
bronze statues, they never turn green from verdigris. A bronze
golem is 10 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds. A bronze
golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have
any distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth
gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.

The interior of a bronze golem is molten metal. Creatures hit by
one in combat suffer an additional 1d10 damage from the heat
(unless resistant to heat or fire). If one is hit in combat,
molten metal spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage.
A save vs. Death Ray is allowed to avoid the metal spray.

[-- Image: graphics94 --]When a bronze golem enters combat,
there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its elemental

golem. The golem wears whatever clothing its creator desires,
usually just a ragged pair of trousers. It has no possessions
and no weapons. It stands 8 feet tall and weighs almost 500
pounds. A flesh golem cannot speak, although it can emit a
hoarse roar of sorts. It walks and moves with a stiff-jointed
gait, as if not in complete control of its body.

When a flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1%

A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh
golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.
A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow
effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3

This golem has a humanoid body made from iron. An iron golem can
be fashioned in any manner, just like a stone golem (see below),
although it almost always displays armor of some sort. Its
features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron
golems sometimes carry a short sword in one hand. An iron golem
is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem
cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any
distinguishable odor. It moves with a ponderous but smooth
gait. Each step causes the floor to tremble unless it is on a
thick, solid foundation.

Iron golems can exhale a cloud of poisonous gas which fills a
10-foot cube and persists for 1 round. Those within the area of
effect must save vs. Dragon Breath or die. This ability can be
used up to 3 times per day.

A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows an iron
golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A
magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on
the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 full points of
damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing
would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, the
excess is ignored. For example, an iron golem hit by a fireball
gains back 6 hit points if the damage total is 19 points. An
iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that
of a rust monster, suffering 2d6 points of damage for each hit
(with no saving throw normally allowed).

This golem has a humanoid body made from stone. A stone golem is
9 feet tall and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Its body is
frequently stylized to suit its creator. For example, it might
look like it is wearing armor, with a particular symbol carved
on the breastplate, or have designs worked into the stone of
its limbs.

Stone golems are formidable opponents, being physically powerful
and difficult to harm. A stone golem can use a slow effect, as
the spell, once every other round; a save vs. Spells is allowed
to resist. The effect has a range of 10 feet and a duration of
2d6 rounds.

A stone to flesh spell may be used to weaken the monster. The
spell does not actually change the golem’s structure, but for
one full round after being affected, the golem is vulnerable to
normal weapons. The stone golem is allowed a save vs. Spells to
resist this effect.

other round. A save vs. Petrification is allowed to resist.

A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder,
measures 8 feet from snout to tail, and weighs about 4,000

Gray oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They
inhabit underground areas, scouring caverns, ruins, and
dungeons in search of organic matter, living or dead. A gray
ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of
about 6 inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.

A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves
organic material and metal, but not stone. After a successful
hit, the ooze will stick to the creature attacked, dealing 2d8
damage per round automatically. Normal (non-magical) armor or
clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately. A
non-magical metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray ooze
also dissolves immediately. Magical weapons, armor, and
clothing are allowed a saving throw (use the wearer's save vs.

Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and
is even capable of dissolving metal given enough time. Bright
green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and
ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter.
It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and
possible food) below. Green slime cannot grow in sunlight; even
the indirect sunlight of a dense forest will stunt it and
prevent it from spreading, and direct sunlight will kill green
slime outright within a turn.

On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a
creature (most likely destroying the scraping device), but
after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing the
same damage to both the victim and the slime). A cure disease
spell will destroy a patch of green slime. It does not harm
stone or enchanted metal, but can dissolve normal metal or
enchanted wood in a turn and normal wood in 2d4 rounds.

If not destroyed or scraped off within 6+1d4 rounds, the victim
will be completely transformed into green slime; such a
character or creature cannot be retrieved by any magic short of

Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to feed on
horses, the beast’s preferred prey. They hunt and travel in
ocks. A Griffon will attack a horse over anything else,
diving low to swipe with their claws. They are not above

Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity, but
even in this case they may try to attack horses if any come

creatures (other than harpies) within a 300' radius must
succeed on a save vs. Spells or become charmed. The same

taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into
a dangerous area (through ame, off a cliff, or the like), that
creature is allowed a second saving throw to resist the charm.

A hellhound's breath weapon is a cone of flame 10' wide at the
far end which is 10' long for those with 3 or 4 hit dice, 20'
long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and 30' long for the
largest hellhounds. This breath weapon does 1d6 points of
damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area
of effect; a successful saving throw vs. Dragon Breath reduces
damage to half normal.

Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice
each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the
hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3. A hellhound has an
Armor Class equal to 11 plus its hit dice.

Hippogriffs resemble large ying horses with the forefront of a
bird of prey. A typical hippogriff is 9 feet long, has a
wingspan of 20 feet, and weighs 1,000 pounds.

A hippogriff avoids the territories and civilizations of other
creatures, dwelling in extreme altitudes. Griffons sometimes
prey upon them, and hippogriffs will generally attack griffons
on sight if they have a numerical advantage.

Hippogriffs are omnivorous, entering combat only as defense,
save for those times a griffon is met. They are prized as
flying mounts since, unlike griffons, they are relatively safe
around horses; note that it is still necessary to raise one in
captivity in order to use it as a mount. A light load for a
hippogriff is up to 400 pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hobgoblins are larger cousins of goblins, being about the same
size as humans. Their hair color ranges from dark reddish-brown
to dark gray. They have dark orange or red-orange skin. Large
males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblins' eyes are yellowish or
dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to
be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather.
Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair. They wear
toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. As with
most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.

[-- Image: graphics75 --]Hobgoblins are cruel and calculating
warriors, always looking to exploit those weaker than
themselves. They have a strong grasp of strategy and tactics
and are capable of carrying out sophisticated battle plans.
Under the leadership of a skilled strategist or tactician,
their discipline can prove a deciding factor. Hobgoblins hate
elves and attack them first in preference over other opponents.

One out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice
(145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if
they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every
twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) in chainmail
with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20', having a
+1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or greater,
there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), adding a
shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11) (movement is still 20')
having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail
a morale check as long as the king is alive. In addition, a lair
has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or
1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a
witch or warlock. A shaman is equivalent to a hobgoblin warrior
statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d6+1. A
witch or warlock is equivalent to a regular hobgoblin, but has
Magic-User abilities of level 1d6.

[-- Image: graphics88 --]Hydras are reptile-like monsters with
multiple heads. They are gray-brown to dark brown, with a light
yellow or tan underbelly. The eyes are amber and the teeth are
yellow-white. Hydras are about 20 feet long and weigh about
4,000 pounds. They are bad-tempered and territorial, but not
particularly cunning.

A hydra may be slain by damage in the normal fashion; however,
most who fight them choose to strike at their heads. If a
character using a melee weapon chooses to strike at a
particular head, and succeeds in doing 8 points of damage, that
head is disabled (severed or severely damaged) and will not be
able to attack anymore. Such damage also applies to the
monster's total hit points, of course.

Some hydras live in the ocean; use the given movement as a
swimming rate rather than walking in this case. A very few
hydras can breathe fire; those that have this ability can emit
a flame 10' wide and 20' long one time per head per day. This
attack will be used about one time in three (1-2 on 1d6) if it
is available; roll for each head which is attacking. Each such
attack does 3d6 damage, with a save vs. Dragon Breath reducing
the amount by half.

Hyenas are doglike carnivores who exhibit some of the behaviors
of canines but are not related. They not only hunt but also
scavenge and steal meals. A hungry hyena will chew on anything
that is even remotely tainted by blood, meat or other food
traces. They will mostly be found in the same savanna-like
environments where lions and zebras may be found. They can live
in clans of up to a hundred individuals, though smaller groups
are more common. They are among the favorite pets of gnolls,
who may take them into regions where they are not normally
found.

These ancient four legged predators are named for their tooth
shape, and while they are not technically prehistoric hyenas,

sometimes no bigger than a common hyena, and the statistics for
standard hyenas may be used for them. The above statistics are
for the larger types of Hyenodons or giant varieties of Hyena.
A notable feature is that their massively built skull features

An insect swarm is not a single creature; rather, it is a large
group of ordinary flying or crawling insects moving as a unit.
In general, a swarm fills a volume equal to three 10' cubes,
though it is possible for a swarm to become more compact in
order to move through a small doorway or narrow corridor. If
the swarm consists of crawling insects, it covers three 10'
squares and the flying movement above is ignored.

Any living creature within the volume or area of the swarm
suffers 1d3 points of damage each round. Damage rolls are
doubled if the victim is unarmored (for creatures which do not
wear armor, any creature having less than Armor Class 15 is
considered unarmored).

[-- Image: Image24 --]Damage is reduced to a single point per
round for three rounds if the character manages to exit the
swarm. It is possible to “ward off” the insects by swinging a
weapon, shield, or other similar-sized object around, and in
this case also damage is reduced to 1 point per round. If a lit
torch is used in this way, the swarm takes 1d4 damage per round.
Weapons, even magic weapons, do not harm an insect swarm. An
entire swarm can be affected by a sleep spell. Smoke can be
used to drive a swarm away (if the swarm moves away from the
victim(s) due to smoke, the damage stops immediately). Finally,
a victim who dives into water will take damage for only one more
round.

Invisible stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane
of Air. They sometimes serve wizards and sorcerers, who summon
them to perform specific tasks.

A summoned invisible stalker undertakes whatever task the
summoner commands, even if the task sends it hundreds or
thousands of miles away. The creature follows a command until
the task is completed and obeys only the summoner. However, it
resents protracted missions or complex tasks and seeks to
pervert its instructions accordingly.

Invisible stalkers have an amorphous form. A detect invisible
spell shows only a dim outline of a cloud. Don't forget to
apply the standard penalty of -4 on the attack die when an
invisible stalker is attacked by a creature which is unable to
see it.

[-- Image: graphics51 --]Kobolds are small, dog-faced reptilian
humanoids. A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45
pounds. They prefer ranged combat, closing only when they can
see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can,
kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas. They aim to drive
enemies into the traps, where other kobolds wait to pour
flaming oil over them, shoot them, or drop poisonous vermin
onto them. Kobolds have Darkvision with a range of 60', and
suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright sunlight or
within the radius of light spells. Kobolds typically wear
leather armor in battle.

One out of every six kobolds will be a warrior of 1 Hit Dice (25
XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by
a warrior. In kobold lairs, one out of every twelve will be a
chieftain of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP) with an Armor Class of 14 (11)

shaman being present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is

statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1.

Kobolds are cunning foes. They see all larger races as enemies,
and are thus likely to be hostile when encountered. However,
they are naturally cowardly, and prefer to avoid combat,
leading enemies into ambushes or traps rather than facing them
directly. Sometimes kobold tribes build and inhabit extensive
dungeon areas filled with deadly traps which only they know how
to avoid.

Living Statue

Living statues are magically animated. They are true automatons,
unlike golems, which are animated by elemental spirits. While
this means that living statues have no chance of going

meaningful fashion. They make very effective guards for tombs,
treasure rooms, and similar places.

Living statues can be crafted to resemble any sort of living

and carry shields in battle.

Lizard men are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for
an extended period of time (up to a full turn). They cannot
swim while wearing armor; however, they often hide in the water
even while armored, standing on the bottom with just nose and
eyes exposed (similar to a crocodile). When they are able to

Lizard men are largely indifferent to other races, being

Lycanthrope*

Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves into
animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like any
other human, though those who have been afflicted for a long
time tend to acquire features reminiscent of their animal
forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful
version of the normal animal, but on close inspection, its eyes
(which often glow red in the dark) show a faint spark of
unnatural intelligence.

Lycanthropy is spread like a disease. Any human who loses half
or more of his or her hit points due to lycanthrope bite and/or
claw attacks will subsequently contract the same form of
lycanthropy in 3d6 days. For demi-humans and humanoids,
contracting the disease is fatal in the same time period. A
cure disease cast before the onset is complete will stop the
progress of the disease, but once the time has elapsed, the
transformation is permanent.

In animal form, lycanthropes may be hit only by silver or
magical weapons.

assume an intermediate form (a “ratman”). The ratman form
shares the animal form's immunity to normal weapons, and can
deliver an identical bite, but in this form the wererat may use

A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from
her head instead of hair. The gaze of a medusa will petrify any
creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrification is made.
In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its
gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting
their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC.
It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other
reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa
suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a
medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrification
itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others,
but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to
petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid
mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their
eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the
monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.

Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save
vs. Poison or die in one turn). They attack as a group, not
individually, once per round for 1d6 damage (plus the poison).

A medusa often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding
its face behind a hood or veil. A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet
tall and about the same weight as a human.

[-- Image: graphics76 --]Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no
doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any
humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain. They are
hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many
humans as they can without being discovered.

Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of
dolphins. Also called “sirens,” mermaids often attempt to lure
sailors or other men found near the sea. They accomplish this
by means of their enchanting songs.

A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but
generally has no effect on women. Men within the area of effect
must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward
the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible. If two
mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more
than two gives no extra benefit. Affected men will submit to
anything the mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might
be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.

Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half
fish) and do not breathe water. They can hold their breath for
up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of
strenuous action. However, being out of water more than two
turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per
turn.

Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds
ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can
produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin. This means
that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and
whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one
or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.

Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of the quarter
which are male, most have legs rather than tails. Such will
either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans,
depending on the temperament of the mother. Mermen (those born
with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females. A
small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often
form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their
leader. Such a group is called a pod.

One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Other mermaids can
sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell. Infertile mermaids
usually remain with a fertile sister (or more rarely a close
friend) to help her ensnare men. This explains the first number
appearing given; in any group of 2, one will be infertile.

A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as
they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the
attention of men. Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any
pod includes 2d4-2 children/juveniles (over and above the number
rolled for Number Appearing). Men generally meet mermaids only
in groups of 1 or 2.

[-- Image: graphics77 --]Mermaids arm themselves with spears or
daggers. They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food. Mermaids
sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some
Clerical abilities.

Nixies are small water fairies. As far as anyone knows, all
nixies are female. Most nixies are slim and comely, with
lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair. They often
twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps
woven from colorful seaweed. Nixies prefer not to leave their
lakes. A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45
pounds.

Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm
(similar to charm person). The charm lasts one year (unless
dispelled). A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist. Each nixie
can cast water breathing once per day, with a duration of one
day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of
giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see
Fish, Giant Bass for details).

Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable. However, they
are rarely malicious, attacking only when they feel threatened.

Ochre jellies are ochre-colored amorphous monsters, similar to
the gray ooze in appearance. An ochre jelly can grow to a
diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of about 6 inches. A
typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.

Ochre jellies can only be hit (damaged) by fire or cold. Attacks
with weapons or electricity/lightning cause the creature to
divide into 1d4+1 smaller jellies of 2 hit dice apiece. If
divided, the resulting smaller jellies do 1d6 damage with each

Ogres appear as large, very ugly humans. Adult ogres stand 9 to
10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color
ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists
of poorly cured furs and hides, which add to their naturally
repellent odor. Ogres are brutish and aggressive, but
inherently lazy. They employ direct attacks in combat,
typically using large clubs, axes, or pole arms, generally
causing 2d6 damage. If normal weapons are employed, an ogre has
a +3 bonus to damage due to strength. If an ogre fights
bare-handed, it does 1d8 subduing damage per hit.

[-- Image: graphics107 --]One out of every six ogres will be a
pack leader of 6+1 Hit Dice (500 XP). Ogres gain a +1 bonus to

Orcs are grotesque humanoids bent on war and domination. They
have lupine ears, reddish eyes, truncated, upturned noses, and
black hair (but very little body hair). An adult male orc is a
little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds; females
are slightly smaller. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that
many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood red,
mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. They utilize all
manner of weapons and armor scavenged from battlefields.

Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60'. They suffer a -1 attack
penalty in bright sunlight or within the radius of a spell
causing magical light. They speak their own rough and simple
language, but many also speak some common or goblin.

One out of every eight orcs will be a warrior of 2 Hit Dice (75
XP). Orcs gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a
warrior. In orc lairs, one out of every twelve will be a
chieftain of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) in chainmail with an Armor
Class of 15 (11), a movement 20', and having a +1 bonus to
damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or more, there will be
an orc king of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP), with an Armor Class of 16

bonus to damage. In the lair, orcs never fail a morale check as

A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weigh up to

Pixies are winged fairies often found in forested areas. They
wear bright clothing, often including a cap and shoes with
curled and pointed toes. A pixie stands about 2-1/2 feet tall
and weighs about 30 pounds.

A pixie can become invisible at will, as many times per day as
it wishes, and can attack while remaining invisible. Anyone
attacking an invisible pixie does so with an attack penalty of
-4 unless the attacker can somehow detect invisible creatures.
Pixies may ambush their foes while invisible; if they do so,
they surprise on 1-5 on 1d6.

Pixies are whimsical, enjoying nothing so much as a good joke or
prank, especially at the expense of a “big person” like a human
or demi-human.

Pixies can only fly for 3 turns maximum before requiring rest of
at least one turn, during which time the pixie may walk at
normal speed but may not fly.

Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely
found above ground. The body of a mature purple worm is 5-8 feet
in diameter and 60-100 feet long, weighing about 40,000 pounds.

The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail; those injured
by it must save vs. Poison or die. Note that the purple worm's
movement is less than the monster's length, so that, if
attacking from out of a tunnel, it might not be able to use the
stinger for several rounds.

Any time a purple worm successfully bites a man-sized or smaller
opponent with a natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been
swallowed, and will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due
to being digested. A character who has been swallowed can only
effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such
as dagger or shortsword.

These omnivorous rodents thrive almost anywhere. Normal rats
attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm
reduces their numbers by one animal.

Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests
and territories. A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long
and weigh over 50 pounds. A single giant rat, or a small group
of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack
fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.

Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease. A character
who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates
disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will
lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each
point, the character is allowed a save vs. Death Ray (adjusted
by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the
fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero
Constitution is dead. See Constitution Point Losses in the
Encounter section for details on regaining lost Constitution.

The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and scorpions, though
it is not properly either. Rhagodessas have “pedipalps,” an
elongated extra pair of legs in front that have sticky pads on
them for capturing prey.

Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony. Those found in desert
terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while
those found underground may be black or white in color (those
found in the deepest caverns are always white). Like spiders,
they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or
otherwise climb entirely upside down.

A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast, and
will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth the next round and
automatically hit for 2d8 damage. The rhagodessa will not use
its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way,
and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs. If
threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will
attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.

Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a “normal” roc is
huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan of 24 feet.
Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around
48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive
wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark
brown or golden from head to tail. Like most birds, the males
have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color
and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be
hidden, that is).

A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load
is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope
to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up
to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1200. Giant rocs can
easily lift up to 3000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when
carrying up to 6000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off
full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a
young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous
birds.

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in
its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to
devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks
against a single creature results in that creature being
carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the
roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be
further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given
to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is
solitary). A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack
any man-sized or larger creature that appears edible. A mated
pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend
their nests or hatchlings.

Rot grubs are 1-inch long vermin found in carrion, dung, and
other such garbage and organic material. Their skin color is
white or brown. When a living creature contacts an area (dung
heap, offal, etc) infested with rot grubs, the grubs will
attack if they can come in contact the victim’s skin. A rot
grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into
the flesh. A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim
succeeds at a Wisdom check. If successful, the victim sees
strange rippling beneath his skin. If failed, the creature does
not notice the grubs. During the first two rounds, a burrowing
rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or
by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon.
Either method deals 2d6 points of damage to the victim, but
kills the grubs. After the second round, only a cure disease
can kill the grubs as they burrow to the victim’s heart and
devour it in 1d3 turns.

The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan
underside to a rust-red upper back. A rust monster’s prehensile
antennae can rust metals on contact. The typical rust monster
measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing 200 pounds.

A rust monster's touch transforms metal objects into rust (or
verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate). Non-magical metal
attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such
as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined. A
non-magical metal weapon used to attack the monster does half
damage before being destroyed. Magic weapons or armor lose one
“plus” each time they make contact with the rust monster;
this loss is permanent.

its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored

Salamanders are large, lizard-like creatures from the elemental
planes. They are sometimes found on the material plane; they
can arrive through naturally-occurring dimensional rifts, or
they may be summoned by high-level Magic-Users. Due to their
highly magical nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical
weapons.

Flame salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Fire. They
look like giant snakes, more than 12' long, with dragonlike
heads and lizard forelimbs. Their scales are all the colors of
flame, red and orange and yellow. A flame salamander is flaming
hot, and all non-fire-resistant creatures within 20' of the
monster suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the heat.
They are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack. Flame
salamanders are intelligent; they speak the language of the
Plane of Fire, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or
Dragon.

[-- Image: graphics124 --]Frost salamanders come from the
Elemental Plane of Water. They look like giant lizards with six
legs. Their scales are the colors of ice, white, pale gray and
pale blue. Frost salamanders are very cold, and all
non-cold-resistant creatures within 20' suffer 1d8 points of
damage per round from the cold. Frost salamanders are
completely immune to all types of cold-based attacks. They are
quite intelligent; all speak the language of the Plane of
Water, and many also speak Common, Elvish, and/or Dragon.

Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each type will
attack the other on sight, in preference over any other foe. If
summoned by a Magic-User, a salamander is often assigned to
protect a location, doorway, or treasure hoard; in such a case,
the salamander will attack anyone attempting to gain
unauthorized access to the protected area. Those which arrive
through natural rifts may have any goals or motivations the GM
wishes, and thus may choose to parley, fight, or even ignore
adventurers.

They are aggressive predators and generally attack on sight. If
a claw attack hits, the giant scorpion receives a +2 attack

dark or gloomy areas but stands out starkly in brightly
illuminated places. They lurk in dark places, waiting for
living prey to happen by. A shadow is 5 to 6 feet tall and is
weightless. Shadows cannot speak intelligibly. Despite their
strange nature and appearance, shadows are not undead monsters,
and thus cannot be Turned by a Cleric.

A shadow's attack does 1d4 damage (from cold) and drains 1 point
of Strength from the victim. Victims reduced to 2 or fewer
points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those
reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at
nightfall). Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are
recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.

Due to their incorporeal nature, shadows cannot be harmed by
non-magical weapons.

Giant shrews resemble giant rats, but are larger, being up to 6'
long, and darker in color. They have a very fast metabolic rate
and must eat almost constantly. Giant shrews are omnivorous,
and aggressively defend their nests and the immediate territory
around them.

Giant shrews move so swiftly that they are able to bite twice
per round, and they may attack two different adjacent opponents
in this way.

A few giant shrew species (generally no more than 5% of those
encountered) are venomous. The bite of such a giant shrew will
kill the victim unless a save vs. Poison is made. A victim
bitten twice in a round need only save once for that round, but
of course will have to save again in subsequent rounds if bitten
again. Venomous giant shrews are considered 1* with respect to

A shrieker is a large (3' to 5' tall and about the same size

defense mechanism when disturbed. Shriekers live in dark,
subterranean places. They come in several shades of purple.

[-- Image: graphics53 --]A shrieker has no means of attack.
Instead, it lures monsters to its vicinity by emitting a loud
noise. Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker
causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3
rounds. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed
to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers
learn that the fungus’ noise means there is food nearby. In
game terms, the GM should roll a wandering monster check each
round that a shrieker shrieks.

Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes. There are many varieties
ranging in size from 2' to 12' at adulthood; the statistics
above are for an “average” variety which reaches about 9' in
length.

Those bitten by a pit viper must save vs. Poison or die.

Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive “pits” between
their eyes and nostrils. These are used to detect birds,
mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes. Note
that, even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can
still sense them because their temperature will often be
slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.

Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the
details given above, a rattlesnake has a rattle (from which it
gets its name) at the end of its tail. The rattle is used to
warn away larger creatures.

Sea snakes are relatively small; the largest varieties rarely
exceed 6' in length. They have relatively small heads, and are
very stealthy in the water. Their bite does so little damage
that the creature bitten has only a 50% chance to notice the
attack, but their poison is terribly strong, such that any
creature bitten must save vs. Poison at a penalty of -4 or die.

Fortunately, sea snakes rarely attack; only if molested
(grabbed, stepped on, etc.) will they do so. They are very
clumsy when out of the water.

venom up to 5', and any creature hit must roll a save vs.
Poison or be blinded permanently (though the cure blindness
spell can be used to heal this injury). If the cobra cannot
deter a creature by spitting, it will attack using its bite. In
this case, those successfully hit must save vs. Poison or die.

genders are marked with an orange “hourglass” on the abdomen.

black widow spiders spin strong, sticky, nearly invisible webs,
usually across passageways or cave entrances, or sometimes

the giant tarantula is poisonous; those bitten must save vs.
Poison or be forced to dance wildly. The dance lasts 2d10
rounds, during which time the victim has a -4 penalty on attack
and saving throw rolls. If the victim is a Thief, he or she
cannot use any Thief abilities while dancing. Onlookers must
save vs. Spells or begin dancing themselves; such “secondary”
victims suffer the same penalties as above, but they will only
dance for 2d4 rounds.

Each round the original victim dances, he or she must save vs.
Poison again or take 1d4 points of damage. Secondary victims do
not suffer this effect.

A treant is a large, roughly humanoid tree-man. Treants have
leaves of deep green in the spring and summer. In the fall and
winter the leaves change to yellow, orange, or red, but they
rarely fall out. A treant’s legs fit together when closed to
look like the trunk of a tree, and a motionless treant is
nearly indistinguishable from a tree. A treant is about 30 feet
tall, with a “trunk” about 2 feet in diameter. It weighs about
4,500 pounds.

[-- Image: graphics55 --]Treants speak their own language, plus
Common and Elvish. Most also can manage a smattering of just
about all other humanoid tongues, at least enough to say “Get
away from my trees!” Treants prefer to watch potential foes
carefully before attacking. They often charge suddenly from
cover to trample the despoilers of forests. If sorely pressed,
they animate trees as reinforcements.

A treant can animate trees within 180' at will, controlling up
to two trees at a time. It takes one round for a normal tree to
uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10' and fights
as a treant in all respects. Such trees lose their ability to
move if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves

Troglodytes are very intelligent lizardlike humanoid creatures.
They have large red eyes and spiny “combs” on their legs, head,
and arms. They normally stand 5 to 6 feet tall. They can change
color at will, and 50% of the time a group can blend into the
environment well enough to surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6.
Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise
round due to their excellent ambush skills.

Troglodytes secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin
supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard
character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10
feet of the Troglodyte must make a saving throw versus poison.
Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls
while they remain within range of the Troglodyte. Getting out
of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates
the penalty. The results of the original save last a full 24
hours, after which a new save must be rolled.

Troglodytes are very hostile, attacking equal or weaker
non-troglodyte groups on sight. They prefer to attack with
surprise, depending on their color-changing ability for this.

[-- Image: graphics67 --]One out of every eight troglodytes will
be a warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) that gains a +1 bonus to
damage due to Strength. Troglodytes gain a +1 bonus to their

A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
A troll’s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray,
or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron
gray. They appear sexless if examined, and their method of
reproduction is a mystery. Trolls walk upright but hunched
forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when
they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all
this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.

Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit point of
damage each round after being injured. A troll reduced to 0 hit
points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6 rounds, at which
point it will regain 1 hit point. Note that the troll may “play
dead” until it has regenerated further. Damage from fire and
acid cannot be regenerated, and must heal at the normal rate; a
troll can only be killed by this sort of damage. The lower
morale rating (in parentheses) is used when the troll faces
attackers armed with fire or acid. If a troll loses a limb or
body part, the lost portion regrows in one turn; or, the
creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding
it to the stump.

Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat and bloodshed.
Though trolls could easily use a variety of weapons, they much
prefer the sensation of flesh being rent by their teeth and
claws.

Unicorns are horselike creatures having a single
spirally-twisted horn in the middle of the forehead. A typical
adult unicorn grows to 8 feet in length, stands 5 feet high at
the shoulder, and weighs 1,200 pounds. Females are slightly
smaller and slimmer than males. A unicorn has deep sea-blue,
violet, brown, or fiery gold eyes. Males sport a white beard.

Unicorns normally attack only when defending themselves or their
forests. They either charge, impaling foes with their horns like
lances, or strike with their hooves. The horn is a +3 magic
weapon, though its power fades if removed from the unicorn.

Three times per day a unicorn can cast cure light wounds by a
touch of its horn. Once per day a unicorn can transport itself
360' (as the spell dimension door), and can carry a full load
(possibly including a rider) while doing so. A light load for a
unicorn is up to 300 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.

An Alicorn resembles a unicorn in all details, save that they
always have yellow, orange or red eyes, and (if one gets close
enough to see) pronounced, sharp canine teeth. Alicorns are as
evil as unicorns are good, using their razor-sharp horns and
clawlike hooves as weapons. They attack any weaker creatures
for the sheer pleasure of killing, but will try to avoid
stronger parties.

[-- Image: Image22 --]Alicorns cannot heal or transport
themselves by magic as unicorns do. However, alicorns may
become invisible at will, exactly as if wearing a ring of
invisibility.

These creatures appear to be normal hobgoblins, but urgoblins
are actually a mutant subspecies. Urgoblins are able to
regenerate much as do trolls (with the same limitations). All
urgoblins are male; if an urgoblin mates with a female
hobgoblin, any offspring will also be male, but only one in
four such offspring will share their father's gifts. Like
hobgoblins, urgoblins wear toughened hides and carry wooden
shields into battle, blending in perfectly.

Some hobgoblin tribes consider urgoblins an abomination, and
kill them whenever they can be identified. Other hobgoblin
tribes employ them as bodyguards for the chieftain, and accord
them great honor. There are even rumors of a tribe entirely
made up of urgoblins, with kidnapped hobgoblin females as their
mates; reportedly they slit the throats of all infants born to
their mates, so that only those who have the power of
regeneration survive.

Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their
features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look
of wolves. They often embrace finery and decadence and may
assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance,
vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and
throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they
knew in life.

A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. Spells
is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of
the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not
resist being bitten by the vampire.

The bite inflicts 1d3 damage, then each round thereafter one
energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire
regenerates a 1d6 hit points (if needed) for each energy level
drained. If the victim dies from the energy drain, he or she
will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than
12 hours later). Vampires spawned in this way are under the
permanent control of the vampire who created them.

If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to
Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For
this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have
great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using
melee weapons, and a vampire will generally choose to use a
melee weapon (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than
attempting to bite.

[-- Image: graphics30 --]Vampires are unharmed by non-magical
weapons, and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm and
hold spells. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire
is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will
begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per
turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is
restored.

Vampires command the lesser creatures of the night and once per
day can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats, 10d10 bats, 3d6
giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves (assuming any such
creatures are nearby). These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and
serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.

A vampire can assume the form of a giant bat or a dire wolf at
will, requiring one round to complete the transformation. The
flying movement listed is for the giant bat form. In animal
form, the vampire can use the normal attacks for that form. It
can't use its other powers while in animal form, except that
creatures summoned are still controlled, and charms already in
effect continue in effect.

For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses:

Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of
garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they
recoil from a mirror or a strongly presented holy symbol. These
things don’t harm the vampire – they merely keep it at bay. A
recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from a
creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or
make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for
the rest of the encounter.

Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they
can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard
a ship. They are utterly unable to enter a home or other
building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do
so. They may freely enter public places, since these are by
definition open to all.

Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower
incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it, as described
above. However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any
vampire to direct sunlight disorients it: It can act for only
one round and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it
cannot escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water
robs it of one-third of its hit points each round until it is
destroyed at the end of the third round of immersion. Driving a
wooden stake through a vampire’s heart instantly slays the
monster. However, it returns to life if the stake is removed,
unless the body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as described
above, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre.

Giant water termites vary from 1' to 5' in length. They attack
using a noxious spray with a range of 5' which stuns the target
for a full turn on a hit; a save vs. Poison is allowed to avoid
the effect. A stunned character can neither move nor take
action for the remainder of the current round and all of the
next one.

However, the primary concern regarding these monsters is the
damage they can do to boats and ships. Each creature can do 2d4
points of damage to a ship's hull per round (no roll required)
for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus the creature's hit
dice total; after this time, the monster is full. They eat
noisily.

These creatures are found in fresh and salt water as well as in
swamps. The freshwater variety tend to be smaller, 1-2 hit
dice, the saltwater variety 3-4 hit dice, and those found in
swamps range from 2-3 hit dice.

Giant weasels resemble their more normally sized cousins, having
long bodies, short legs, and pointed, toothy snouts. They are
predatory animals, hunting those creatures smaller than
themselves.

Weasels of all sorts are cunning, crafty hunters, and surprise
their prey on 1-3 on 1d6. Once a giant weasel bites a living
creature, it hangs on, rending with its teeth each round until
the victim or the weasel is dead, or until the weasel fails a
morale check (rolled normally) in which case it will let go of
its victim and flee.

There are many varieties of normal-sized weasel, including
several which are called ferrets; in some territories, the
giant weasel is thus called a giant ferret. The only
distinction is that those which are tamed are always called
ferrets, though not all giant ferrets are tame. Various
humanoid races as well as some fairy creatures are known to
tame giant ferrets for use as guards or war-animals.

These ferocious creatures are about 30 feet long. Killer whales,
also called “orca” (both singular and plural), are strikingly
marked in black and white, with prominent white patches that
resemble eyes. Their real eyes are much smaller and located
away from the fake eye-spots.

Killer whales eat fish, squid, seals, and other whales, but are
not above consuming a meal of human or demi-human fare.

Narwhals are aquatic mammals resembling large dolphins with a
single (or rarely, double) tusk protruding straight forward
from the mouth. The tusk is helical in shape, and they are
sometimes cut short and sold as “unicorn horns.” However, they
have no particular magical value. Narwhals are found in cold
northern seas. They are not particularly aggressive.

These creatures can be up to 60 feet long. They prey on giant
squid. Sperm whales can emit an invisible focused beam of sound
5' wide up to a 50' range underwater. This blast of sound
disorients target creatures, leaving them effectively stunned
for 1d4 rounds. A stunned character can neither move nor take
action for the indicated duration. No attack roll is required,
but a save vs. Death Ray is allowed to resist. A sperm whale
can emit as many such blasts of sound as it desires, once per
round, instead of biting.

A wight’s appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the
form it had in life. A wight is about the height and weight of
a human. Wights do not possess any of the abilities they had in
life.

If a wight touches (or is touched by) a living creature, that
living creature suffers one level of energy drain (as described
in the Encounter section). No saving throw is allowed. Striking
a wight with a weapon does not count as “touching” it.

Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight by the next sunset
(but not less than 12 hours later). Wight spawn are under the
command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved
until its death.

Like all undead, wights may be Turned by Clerics and are immune
to sleep, charm and hold magics. Wights are harmed only by
silver or magical weapons, and take only half damage from
burning oil.

Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. In
some cases, the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear
armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance does not
affect the creature’s AC or combat abilities but only reflects
the shape it had in life.

Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to
sleep, charm and hold magics. Due to their incorporeal nature,
they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

A distant cousin to the true dragons, the wyvern is a huge
flying lizard with a poisonous stinger in its tail. A wyvern’s
body is 15 feet long, and dark brown to gray; half that length
is tail. Its wingspan is about 20 feet. A wyvern weighs about
one ton. They are built more like bats than lizards, having two
legs and two wings; contrast this with true dragons, which have
four legs and two wings.

Wyverns are of animal intelligence, but are excellent predators
with good hunting abilities. When attacking they will make a
loud hiss, or sometimes a deep-throated growl much like that of
a bull alligator.

Wyverns attack nearly anything that isn’t obviously more
powerful than themselves. A wyvern dives from the air, clawing
at its opponent with its talons and stinging it to death. Any
living creature hit by the wyvern's stinger must save vs.
Poison or die. A wyvern can slash with its talons only when
making a flyby attack or when landing.

If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carry
off its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less can be
carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim for at most
6 rounds. While flying with a victim, the wyvern cannot make
any further attacks against it, but of course if the victim
makes a nuisance of itself (such as by injuring the wyvern), it
may be dropped.

[-- Image: graphics66 --]Zombies are the undead corpses of
humanoid creatures. They are deathly slow, but they move
silently, are very strong and must be literally hacked to
pieces to “kill” them. They take only half damage from blunt
weapons, and only a single point from arrows, bolts or sling
stones (plus any magical bonus). A zombie never has Initiative
and always acts last in any given round. Like all undead, they
may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to sleep, charm and
hold magics. As they are mindless, no form of mind reading is
of any use against them. Zombies never fail morale checks, and
thus always fight until destroyed.

PART 7: TREASURE

“Your idea was good, Darion,” said Morningstar after we had
turned the sarcophagus lid halfway around. “You just got in a
bit of a hurry to try it.”

“Indeed,” I said, feeling foolish. I looked into the
sarcophagus; lying atop the mummified remains inside I saw a
sword, held in both bony hands with the point toward the
corpse's feet. The golden blade was untarnished; the huge ruby
set into the crossguard shone in the torchlight.

I didn't reach for it, though I found myself sorely tempted.
“Barthal,” I said, “tell me, is it safe to reach within?” The
Halfling climbed up onto the edge of the platform and leaned
over the sarcophagus, peering around within.

“I don't see a trap,” he remarked after careful study. “Do you
think the dead one, there, will rise up if you touch his sword?”

“He might,” answered Apoqulis, “but I doubt it. The skeletons
were likely the only guardians in this tomb.”

All eyes seemed to be on me. Reluctantly I reached within,
grasping the sword by the blade with my mailed glove so as to
avoid touching the corpse. The long-dead chieftain didn't want
to part with his weapon, but after a bit of twisting I worked
it loose.

Shaking bits of desiccated flesh from the hilt, I grasped the
weapon properly and held it aloft. It felt good in my hand… I
wondered what magic it might contain?

Barthal's voice shook me out of my contemplation. “Look here!”
he said, and I looked down. He had opened a secret panel in the
platform… and as I looked on, gold and silver coins began to
spill out. Barthal cried out gleefully, “Jackpot!”

Distribution of Treasure

Some adventurers choose to adventure to battle evil, while other
seek to attain glory or power… but others go in search of
treasure, gold and jewels and magical items. Below is the
information the Game Master will need to satisfy the greedy.

Random Treasure Generation

The tables below describe the various treasure types assigned to
monsters, as well as unguarded treasures appropriate to various
dungeon levels. To generate a random treasure, find the
indicated treasure type and read across; where a percentage
chance is given, roll percentile dice to see if that sort of
treasure is found. If so, roll the indicated dice to determine
how much.

Tables for the random generation of gems, jewelry (and bejeweled
art pieces), and magic items are provided after the main
treasure tables.

Placed Treasures

The Game Master is never required to roll for treasure; rather,
treasure may be placed, or random treasures amended, as desired
or needed for the purposes of the adventure. Special treasures
are always placed; for example, a special magic item needed to
complete an adventure.

Adjusting Treasure Awards

There will be many cases where random treasure generation is not
the best method to employ. For instance, a larger than average
treasure assigned to a smaller than average lair of monsters
might need to be reduced. It is up to the Game Master to decide
how much treasure he or she wishes to allow into the campaign.
Too much gold (or other treasure which can be converted to
gold) may make things too easy for the player characters.
Similarly, too many magic items may also make things too easy.

If you are a novice Game Master, remember that you can always
give more treasure, but it can be difficult to drain treasure
from the party without angering the players… particularly if
you use heavy-handed methods. Start small, and work up as you
gain experience.

Gems and Jewelry

Use the tables below to determine the base value and number
found when gems are indicated in a treasure hoard. If the
number generated in the main table above is small, roll for
each gem; but if the number is large (10 or more, at the GM's
option), after each roll for Type and Base Value, roll the
indicated die to see how many such gems are in the hoard.

Explanation of Magic Items

Using Magic Items

To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes
activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some
items, once donned, function constantly.

Many items are activated just by using them. For instance, a
character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a
shield to deflect a blow in combat, wear a ring, or don a
cloak. Activation of these items is generally straightforward
and self-explanatory. This doesn’t mean that if you use such an
item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or
at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in
order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes
automatically, such as from drinking a potion or swinging a
sword.

If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item
description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command
word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means
that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No
other special knowledge is needed.

A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case,
the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item
accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More
often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or
a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common
use. Note that many magic items must be held in the hand (or
otherwise specially handled or worn) to be used; the risk of
accidental activation is less significant for such items.

Learning the command word for an item may be easy (sometimes the
word is actually inscribed on the item) or it may be difficult,
requiring the services of a powerful wizard or sage, or some
other means of discovery.

Only the character holding or wearing a magic item may activate
it. A character who has been gagged or silenced may not
activate a magic item which requires a command word.

When an article of magic armor, clothing or jewelry (including a
ring) is discovered, size is not usually an issue. Such items
magically adjust themselves for wearers from as small as
Halflings to as large as Humans. This effect is called
accommodation. The GM may create “primitive” items lacking this
power if he or she wishes.

Generally only one magical item of a given type may be worn at
the same time. For example, a character can normally only wear
one suit of armor, wear one necklace and carry one shield at a
time. In the case of rings, a character may wear one magical
ring per hand. If a character wears more items of a given type
than would normally be practical, the items will usually fail
to function due to interference with one another; for instance,
wearing two rings on the same hand normally results in both
rings failing to operate. Note, however, that this limitation
cannot be used to disable cursed magic items. For example,
wearing a cursed ring would prevent another magic ring from
being worn and used on that hand, but the curse would not be
lifted by donning a second magic ring.

[-- Image: Image8 --]Magic Weapons

Magic weapons are created with a variety of powers and will
usually aid the wielder in combat. A magical weapon's bonus is
applied to all attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

Casts Light on Command: By drawing the weapon and uttering a
command word, the wielder may cause it to glow; it will then
shed light with the same radius as a light spell. Sheathing or
laying down the weapon, or speaking the command word again,
dispels the effect. This power may be used as often as desired.

Charm Person: This power allows the wielder to cast charm person
once per day, as if by an 8th level Magic-User, by brandishing
the weapon, speaking a command word and gazing at the target
creature. (The wielder's gaze does not have to be met for the
spell to be cast.) The target creature is allowed saving throws
just as described in the spell description.

Drains Energy: A weapon with this power drains one life energy
level on a hit, as described under Energy Drain in the
Encounter section; up to 2d4 levels can be drained by a weapon
with this power, after which time the weapon loses this power
but retains any other magical effects or bonuses.

Flames on Command: Upon command, the weapon will be sheathed in
fire. The fire does not harm the wielder. The effect remains
until the command is given again, or until the weapon is
dropped or sheathed. While it flames, all damage done by the
weapon is treated as fire damage, and an additional +1 bonus
(in addition to the weapon's normal bonus) is added to damage
when fighting trolls, treants, and other creatures especially
vulnerable to fire. It casts light and burns just as if it were
a torch.

Locate Objects: This power allows the wielder to cast the spell
locate object once per day, as if by an 8th level Magic-User.

Special Enemy: These weapons are created to combat a specific
sort of creature, as rolled on the Special Ability table. When
used against that specific enemy, the second listed bonus
applies instead of the first; so a sword +1, +3 vs. Undead
would provide +1 attack and damage against giant rats, but +3
attack and damage rolls against zombies.

Wishes: Weapons with this power have the ability to grant 1d4
wishes. The GM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are
given in the Game Master section regarding this. After these
wishes have been made, the weapon loses this power, but retains
any other bonuses and powers.

Cursed Weapons inflict a penalty to the wielder's attack rolls,
as rolled on the Weapon Bonus table. The curse causes the
afflicted character to be unable to get rid of the weapon.
There are two possible forms the curse may take: Obsession and
Affliction. The GM may decide which to use at his or her
option.

Obsession: Regardless of how severe the penalty is, the
character wielding the weapon will believe it is a bonus and
refuse to use any other weapon in combat. A remove curse spell
is the only way to rid a character of such a weapon; but as he
or she will believe the weapon is the best magical weapon ever,
the character receives a saving throw vs. Spells to resist.

Affliction: The character knows the weapon is cursed as soon as
he or she uses it in combat; however, any attempt to throw it
away fails, as the weapon magically appears back in the
character's hand whenever he or she tries to draw any other
weapon. In this case, the remove curse spell needed to rid the
character of the weapon will be unopposed (i.e. no saving
throw).

Magic Armor

Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical
protection to the wearer. In general, magic armor grants the
normal Armor Class for its type, plus the magical armor bonus,
as rolled on the Magic Armor table; for example, Plate Mail +2
provides an Armor Class of 19.

There are two varieties of cursed armor: Cursed Armor -1 and
Cursed Armor AC 11. The first variety's AC is reduced by the
rolled penalty; for example, Plate Mail -1 grants Armor Class
16. The second type is much worse, for regardless of the type,
it only provides Armor Class 11. Dexterity and shield bonuses
still apply.

Cursed armor cannot be removed from the wearer once the curse is
proven, that is, once the wearer is hit in combat. Once the
curse has taken effect, only a remove curse spell, or some more
powerful magic (such as a wish), will enable the wearer to
remove it. The armor will detect as magical, like any other
magic armor; the curse cannot be detected by any means other
than wearing the armor in combat.

Potions

A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that
affects only the drinker. Unless otherwise noted, a potion
grants its benefits for 1d6+6 turns (even if the duration of an
associated spell is longer or shorter).

Clairaudience: This potion enables the drinker to hear sounds in
another area through the ears of a living creature in that area,
up to a maximum 60' away. This effect otherwise functions just
as the spell clairvoyance.

Clairvoyance: This potion grants the imbiber the effect of the
clairvoyance spell.

Cold Resistance: This potion grants the imbiber the power of the
spell resist cold.

Control Animal: This potion functions like a control human
potion, but affects only normal, non-magical animals.

Control Dragon: This potion functions like a control human
potion, but affects only dragons.

Control Giant: This potion functions like a control human
potion, but affects only giants.

Control Human: This potion allows the drinker to charm a human,
demi-human, or humanoid by gazing at them. The effect functions
like the charm person spell. If the charm is resisted, the
drinker can attempt to charm up to two more targets before the
potion’s benefit is exhausted.

Control Plant: This potion grants the drinker control over one
or more plants or plant creatures within a 10' square area up
to 50' away. Normal plants become animated, having a movement
rate of 10', and obey the drinker's commands. If ordered to
attack, only the largest plants can do any real harm, attacking
with a +0 attack bonus and inflicting 1d4 points of damage per
hit. Affected plant creatures (who fail to save vs. Spells) can
understand the drinker, and behave as if under a charm monster
spell.

Control Undead: This potion grants the drinker command of 3d6
hit dice of undead monsters. A save vs. Spells is allowed to
resist the effect. Mindless undead follow the drinker's
commands exactly; free-willed undead act as if under a charm
person spell.

Delusion: This cursed potion will appear, if tested or analyzed,
to be one of the other potions (other than poison). When
imbibed, the drinker will briefly believe he has received the
benefits of the “other” potion, but the illusion will be
swiftly exposed…

Diminution: This potion reduces the drinker and all items worn
or carried to one-twelfth of his or her original height (so
that a 6' tall character becomes 6” tall). The drinker's weight
is divided by 1,728; this makes an armed warrior weigh less than
2.5 ounces. The affected creature cannot make an effective
attack against any creature bigger than a house cat, but may be
able to slip under doors or into cracks and has a 90% chance of
moving about undetected (both in terms of sound and vision).

ESP: This potion grants the power of the spell of the same name.

Fire Resistance: This potion grants the imbiber the power of the
spell resist fire.

Flying: This spell grants the power of the spell fly.

Gaseous Form: The drinker and all of his or her gear become
insubstantial, misty, and translucent. He or she becomes immune
to non-magical weapons, and has an Armor Class of 22 vs. magical
weapons. The imbiber can’t attack or cast spells while in
gaseous form. The drinker also loses supernatural abilities
while in gaseous form. A gaseous creature can fly at a speed of
10', and can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even
mere cracks, as long as the potion persists. The gaseous
creature is subject to the effects of wind, and can’t enter
water or other liquid. Objects cannot be manipulated in this
form, even those brought along when the potion was imbibed. The
drinker cannot resume material form at will, but must wait for
the potion to expire; however, the potion may be quaffed in
thirds, in which case each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.

Giant Strength: This potion grants the imbiber the Strength of a
giant. For the duration, the drinker gains a bonus of +5 on
attack and damage rolls with melee or thrown weapons, and can
throw large stones just as a stone giant can.

Growth: The drinker of this potion (with all equipment worn or
carried) becomes twice normal height and eight times normal
weight. The enlarged character is treated as having the
Strength of a Stone Giant (but without the rock-throwing
ability), gaining +5 on attack and damage rolls.

Healing: The imbiber of this potion receives 1d6+1 hit points of
healing (as the spell cure light wounds).

Heroism: This potion improves the fighting ability of the
drinker. Fighters of less than 3rd level gain +3 to attack
bonus as well as gaining 3 hit dice. Fighters of 4th to 5th
level gain +2 to attack bonus and 2 hit dice. Fighters of 6th
or 7th level gain +1 to attack bonus and 1 hit die. Fighters of
8th level or higher, as well as non-Fighter class characters,
gain no hit dice, but still receive +1 to attack bonus. Hit
dice gained are only temporary, and damage received is deducted
from those hit dice first; any that remain when the potion
expires are simply lost.

Invisibility: This potion makes the imbiber invisible (as the
spell). This potion may be quaffed in thirds, in which case
each drink lasts 1d4+1 turns.

Invulnerability: This potion grants a bonus of +2 to Armor
Class.

Levitation: This potion grants the power of the spell levitate.

Longevity: The drinker of this potion becomes younger by 1d10
years.

Poison: This isn't a potion at all, it's a trap. The drinker
must save vs. Poison or die, even if only a sip was imbibed.

Polymorph Self: This potion grants the power of the spell of the
same name.

Speed: This potion gives the drinker the benefits of the spell
haste.

Treasure Finding: The imbiber of this potion will immediately
know the direction and approximate distance to the largest
treasure hoard in a 300' spherical radius. This potion
specifically detects platinum, gold, electrum, silver, and
copper; gemstones and magic items are not detected.

Scrolls

Most scrolls contain some sort of magic which is activated when
read, and which may only be used once; the characters burn away
as the words are read.

Spell Scrolls are enchanted with one or more Cleric or
Magic-User spells (never both sorts on the same scroll). Each
spell can be used just once, though of course the same spell
may appear multiple times on a single scroll. Use the table
below to determine the spell level of each spell on a scroll.
Only a Cleric can use a Clerical scroll, and only a Magic-User
can use a Magic-User scroll.

Magic-Users must cast read magic on a spell scroll before being
able to use it; each scroll needs to be treated in this way
just once, and the effect lasts indefinitely thereafter. If a
Magic-User attempts to cast a spell from a scroll, and he or
she does not know that spell, there is a 10% chance the spell
will fail. If a spell on a scroll is of higher level than the
highest level spell the Magic-User can cast, for each spell
level of difference, add 10% to the chance of failure. For
example, Aura the 3rd level Magic-User attempts to cast
polymorph self from a scroll. Aura is able to cast, at most,
2nd level spells. Polymorph self is a 4th level spell, so Aura
has a chance of failure of 10% (she doesn't know the spell)
plus 20% (2nd level maximum vs. 4th level spell), for a total
of 30%.

Clerical scrolls are written in a normal language (being just
specially enchanted prayers), so the Cleric merely needs to
know the language in which the scroll is written in order to
use it. Clerics suffer the same chance of failure as do
Magic-Users, save that the 10% penalty assigned for not knowing
the spell does not apply.

need not be read completely; in fact, merely glancing at the
text is enough to inflict the curse. A saving throw may or may
not be allowed, as determined by the GM (though a save vs.
Spells should usually be allowed). The GM is encouraged to be
creative when creating curses; the spell bestow curse (the
reverse of remove curse) can be used for inspiration, but
cursed scrolls can contain more powerful or inventive curses at
the GM's discretion.

Protection Scrolls can be read by any character class, assuming
the character can read the language the scroll is written in
(see the notes under Language in the Character section for
details). When read, a protection scroll creates a 10' radius
protective circle around the reader; preventing the warded
creatures from entering. The circle moves with the reader. Any
creature other than the sort the scroll wards may enter,
including of course the allies of the scroll-reader, who are
themselves protected so long as they remain entirely within the
circle. If any creature within the circle performs a melee
attack against any of the warded creatures, the circle is
broken and the warded creatures may freely attack. Normal
protection scrolls last for 2 turns after being read.

Protection from Magic scrolls are special, as they protect
against magic spells and items rather than creatures. No
magical effect can cross the 10' circle of protection in either
direction for 1d4 turns. As with the other protection scrolls,
the circle created by this scroll moves with the reader.

[-- Image: Image11 --]Treasure Maps are generally non-magical.
They must be created by the GM, although he or she may delay
creating the map until the characters can actually use it. The
treasure indicated on the map will normally be guarded by some
sort of monster, determined by the GM as desired.

Rings

A ring is a circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than
one ring per hand) that has a spell-like power (often a constant
effect that affects the wearer).

Control Animal: The wearer of this ring can charm up to 6 hit
dice of animals. The effect works much like a charm person
spell, but only affects animals (including giant-sized animals,
but excluding fantastic creatures as well as anything more
intelligent than a dog or cat). The wearer can activate the
power at will, targeting any animal within 60' that he or she
can see. The wearer may choose to end the effect for one or
more controlled creatures at any time, in order to “free”
enough hit dice to control a new target.

Control Human: The wearer of this ring may cast the spell charm
person at any target he or she can see within 60'. The wearer
can use this power once per round, at will, but cannot control
more than 6 hit dice of creatures at a time; however, the
wearer may choose to end the effect for one or more controlled
creatures at any time, in order to “free” enough hit dice to
control a new target.

Control Plant: The wearer of this ring may create an effect
equivalent to a potion of plant control at will, affecting
plants or plant creatures within 60' that he or she can see.
The effect lasts as long as the wearer remains within 60' of
the plants or plant creatures. A saving throw is allowed just
as for the potion.

Delusion: This ring appears to be some other sort of ring (roll
again on the rings table to determine what sort). Whoever wears
it believes it is working, and behaves thus (so a character who
believes he is wearing a ring of invisibility will believe
himself to actually be invisible). Unlike the potion of the
same name, the ring's effect is not dispelled by the wearer
taking damage; in fact, the only way to rid a character of this
cursed item is with the spell remove curse.

Djinni Summoning: This ring serves as a special gate by means of
which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane
of Air. When the ring is rubbed, the djinni appears on the next
round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the
ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of
the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes non-magical and
worthless.

Fire Resistance: The wearer of this ring receives protection as
the spell resist fire, but the protection works continually.

Invisibility: By activating this simple silver ring, the wearer
can benefit from invisibility, as the spell. If the
invisibility is dispelled (as described for the spell), the
ring may not be reactivated for one full turn. The invisibility
effect otherwise lasts for 24 hours.

Protection: This ring offers continual magical protection in the
form of a bonus to the Armor Class of the wearer (varying from
+1 to +3 as shown on the table). This bonus is also applied to
the wearer's saving throw die rolls.

Regeneration: This ring grants the wearer the power of
regeneration, exactly as described in the description of the
troll, including the weakness with respect to acid and fire
damage. However, only damage taken while wearing the ring is
regenerated.

Spell Storing: A ring of spell storing contains a number of
Magic-User spells that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a
caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that
spell. Any class may wear and use this ring, but it can only be
recharged by a Magic-User casting the appropriate spell into it.
A table is provided below to determine how many spells, and what
levels they are. A ring of spell storing must be recharged with
the same spells that were placed into it when it was made; so a
ring of two spell storing containing fireball and fly can only
be recharged with those two spells. The ring magically imparts
to the wearer the names of all spells stored within it. A ring
found in a treasure hoard may be completely charged, or
discharged, or partially charged, at the GM's option.

Spell Turning: This ring reflects spells cast directly at the
wearer, but not area effect spells, back at the caster; so a
hold person spell would be reflected, but not a fireball. It
will reflect up to 2d6 spells before its power is exhausted.

Telekinesis: The wearer of this ring can use the power of the
spell telekinesis, as if cast by a 12th level Magic-User. The
effect may be used as many times per day as the wearer wishes,
but lasts only as long as the wearer concentrates on it.

Water Walking: This ring allows the wearer to walk on any liquid
as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running
water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the
wearer’s feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Molten
lava will still cause the wearer damage from the heat since he
or she is still near it. The wearer can walk, run, or otherwise
move across the surface as if it were normal ground.

Weakness: Whoever puts this ring on is cursed; his or her
Strength score is reduced immediately to 3. The ring can only
be removed with remove curse.

Wishes: A ring of wishes contains the power to grant wishes to
the wearer. 1d4 wishes will remain within the ring when it is
found. The GM must adjudicate all wishes, and instructions are
given in the Game Master section regarding this.

X-Ray Vision: On command, this ring gives its possessor the
ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is
20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at
something in normal light even if there is no illumination.
X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a
thin sheet of lead or gold blocks the vision. The ring may be
used three times per day, and each use lasts at most one turn
(or until the wearer ceases to concentrate upon it).

Wands, Staves and Rods

A wand is a short stick, generally 12 to 18 inches long, imbued
with the power to cast a specific spell or spell-like effect. A
newly created wand has 20 charges, and each use of the wand
depletes one of those charges; a wand found in a treasure hoard
will have 2d10 charges remaining. If a wand generates an effect
equivalent to a spell, assume the spell functions as if cast by
a 6th level caster, or the lowest level caster who could cast
that spell (whichever is higher), unless otherwise noted. Wands
are generally usable only by Magic-Users. Saving throws are
rolled as normal, but on the Magic Wands column rather than the
Spells column.

A staff has a number of different (but often related) spell
effects. A newly created staff has 30 charges, and each use of
the staff depletes one or more of those charges. A staff found
in a treasure hoard will have 3d10 charges remaining. Spell
effects generated by a staff operate at 8th level, or the
lowest caster level the spell could be cast by, whichever is
higher, unless otherwise stated. Staves are usable only by
Magic-Users, except where noted. Saving throws against magic
from a staff are rolled on the Spells column.

A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of
any known spell. Rods are normally usable by any class.

Rod of Cancellation: This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items,
for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. If the
item is held by a creature, an attack roll is needed to touch
it. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and
cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by a
wish.

Snake Staff: This item is a walking staff +1. When used by a
Cleric, the user may command the staff to transform into a
constrictor snake (instead of causing damage) on a successful
hit. The snake will wrap around a target up to man sized and
hold him or her fast for 1d4 turns, unless a save vs. Spells is
made. The snake does not attack in any other way, nor cause any
damage. The snake may be recalled by the user at any point, in
which case it returns to his or her hand and returns to staff
form. It also returns in this way when the duration expires, or
if the save is made. The snake has Armor Class 15, moves 20' per
round and has 20 hit points; any hit points of damage taken are
healed completely when the snake returns to staff form; if
killed in snake form, the magic is destroyed and it turns into
a broken stick. The staff may be used any number of times per
day, and neither has nor uses charges.

Staff of Commanding: This staff can cast charm person and charm
monster spells, and can grant a power equivalent to a potion of
plant control. Each function uses one charge.

Staff of Healing: This staff can heal 1d6+1 hit points per
charge expended, as the spell cure light wounds. Alternately,
with an expenditure of two charges, the staff can cast cure
disease. This staff is only usable by a Cleric.

Staff of Power: This is a very potent magic item, with offensive
and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening
gem, its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following powers
costing one charge per use: lightning bolt (6d6 damage),
fireball (6d6 damage), cone of cold (as the wand, for 6d6
damage), continual light, and telekinesis (as the ring, lasting
at most 1d6 turns). The staff is also a +2 walking staff, and
can be used exactly as a staff of striking. A staff of power
can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken
by its wielder. All charges currently in the staff are instantly
released in a 30' radius, doing 1d6 damage per charge remaining
(save vs. Spells for half damage). All within the area,
including the wielder, are affected by this.

After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2
walking staff. Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a
retributive strike.

Staff of Striking: This staff has no attack bonus, but is
treated as a +1 weapon with respect to what sorts of monsters
it can hit (and is usable by any class in that mode). This
staff's primary power may only be used if wielded by a Cleric:
By uttering a command word, the Cleric may create an effect
similar to the spell striking. Expenditure of one charge adds
1d6 damage to the weapon's next strike; expenditure of two
charges adds 2d6, and expenditure of three charges adds 3d6
damage. If the weapon is not successfully used after the
command word has been spoken, the effect dissipates after one
turn.

Staff of Wizardry: This staff is equivalent to the staff of
power, above, and has the following powers as well:
invisibility, passwall, web, and conjure elementals (as the
spell, but conjuring staff elementals as described in the
Monsters section). These powers each use one charge when
activated.

Wand of Cold: This wand generates a conical blast of cold doing
6d8 damage (save vs. Magic Wands for half damage). The cone
spreads from the tip of the wand to a width of 30' at a
distance of 40' away.

Wand of Enemy Detection: The effect of this wand is to make all
enemies of the user within 60' glow with a greenish white light
for one round. Even hidden or invisible enemies glow in this
way, revealing them, but enemies completely out of sight (such
as behind a wall) may not be seen by the user. An “enemy” is
any creature which is thinking of or otherwise intending to
harm the user; also, all undead monsters and animated
constructs within range will glow in this way regardless of
intent or thoughts (or lack thereof).

Wand of Fear: This wand generates the effect of the spell cause
fear (the reverse of the spell remove fear).

Wand of Fireballs: This wand generates fireballs, exactly as the
spell, doing 6d6 damage.

Wand of Illusion: This wand allows the user to create illusions
equivalent to the spell phantasmal force.

Wand of Lightning Bolts: This wand generates lightning bolts,
exactly as the spell, doing 6d6 damage.

Wand of Magic Detection: This wand grants the user a power
equivalent to the spell detect magic.

Wand of Paralyzation: This wand creates the effect of the spell
hold person.

Wand of Polymorph: This wand can be used to cast either
polymorph self or polymorph other.

Wand of Secret Door Detection: This wand grants the user a power
similar to the spell find traps, but which reveals secret doors
rather than traps.

Wand of Trap Detection: This wand grants the user a power
equivalent to the spell find traps.

Miscellaneous Magic Items

Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location: The wearer of
this item is immune to all forms of scrying (including crystal
balls, clairvoyance, clairaudience, and any other means of
location or spying at a distance) as well as any form of mind
reading (such as the spell ESP). Other characters who remain
within 30' of the wearer are also immune to scrying, but not to
mind reading.

Bag of Devouring: This bag appears to be an ordinary sack.
Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a
bag of holding, and in fact it performs exactly like one when
first used. However, all items placed within disappear forever
1d6+6 turns later. The bag continues to weigh whatever it did
after the items were placed within it (that is, one-tenth the
total weight of the items), until it is again opened and
discovered to be empty.

Bag of Holding: This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2
feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into an
extradimensional space, and is able to hold more than should be
possible: up to 500 pounds of weight, and up to 70 cubic feet of
volume. A bag of holding weighs one-tenth as much as the total
of the objects held within. Any object to be stored in a bag of
holding must fit through the opening, which has a circumference
of 4 feet.

If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from
inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All
contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside
out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put
right before it can be used again. If living creatures are
placed within the bag, they can survive for up to one turn,
after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item
from a bag of holding takes a full round during which no
movement may be made.

Boots of Levitation: On command, these leather boots allow the
wearer to levitate as if by the spell of the same name.

Boots of Speed: The wearer of these boots can click his or her
boot heels together, thus activating a haste spell effect for
up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the haste effect need
not be consecutive rounds; the boots can be turned off and on as
desired.

Boots of Traveling and Leaping: These boots increase the
wearer’s base land speed by an additional 10' per round. In
addition to this traveling ability, these boots allow the
wearer to make great leaps, jumping up to 10' high and/or 30'
across.

Bowl Commanding Water Elementals: This large container is
usually fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone. It is
about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively
fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain
words are spoken, a water elemental appears and follows the
commands of the summoner (as described for the Elemental
monster entry). The summoning words require 1 full round to
speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.

Brazier Commanding Fire Elementals: This device appears to be a
normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit
in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a
fire elemental appears and follows the commands of the summoner
(as described for the Elemental monster entry). The summoning
words require 1 full round to speak. Only one such elemental
can be called per day.

Broom of Flying: This broom is able to fly through the air for
up to 9 hours per day (split up as its owner desires). The
broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up
to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can
travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as
he or she has a good idea of the location and layout of that
destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300
yards when the command word is spoken.

Censer Commanding Air Elementals: This 6-inch-wide, 1-inch-high
perforated golden vessel resembles a thurible found in a place
of worship. If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning
words spoken over it summon forth an air elemental which
follows the commands of the summoner (as described for the
Elemental monster entry). The summoning words require 1 full
round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.

Cloak of Displacement: This item appears to be a normal cloak,
but when worn by a character its magical properties distort and
warp light waves, causing the wearer's apparent location to
shift around constantly over a range of 3' from his or her true
location. The first melee or missile attack by any creature
against the wearer will miss, and all further attacks by that
attacker are made with an attack penalty of -2. This is not
cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind.

Crystal Ball: This is the most common form of scrying device, a
crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. They may only be
used by Magic-Users, who can use the device to see over
virtually any distance. A crystal ball can be used three times
per day, for up to a turn each time.

The chance of success when using a crystal ball is as shown
below. Total chances equal to or greater than 100% do not
require a roll.

The user of the crystal ball is the only one who will see the
image. No sound will be heard normally. Detect magic, detect
evil, and ESP have a 3% chance per level of the caster of
operating correctly if used with a crystal ball.

Crystal Ball with Clairaudience: This item works exactly like
the standard crystal ball, above, but also allows the user to
hear any sounds in the location viewed as if he or she were
there.

Drums of Panic: These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about
1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are
unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded,
all creatures of less than 6 hit dice within 120' (with the
exception of those within a 20' radius safe zone around the
drums) must save vs. Spells or flee in fear. The drums can be
used once per day.

Efreeti Bottle: This item is typically fashioned of brass or
bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals; or, it may
be a lamp made of brass. A thin stream of smoke is often seen
issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When
opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle
instantly. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti
is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is
also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle
grants three wishes. In either case, the efreeti afterward
disappears forever. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the
inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to
an hour per day for 101 days (or until the efreeti’s death),
doing as he or she commands. After 101 days have passed, the
efreeti is freed from service and may return to its
extradimensional home. Roll only the first time the bottle is
opened (or the GM may choose which sort of bottle is found as
he or she desires).

Elven Boots: These soft boots enable the wearer to move quietly
in virtually any surroundings, granting a 90% chance of success
when moving silently (as the Thief ability of the same name).

Elven Cloak: This cloak of neutral gray cloth is
indistinguishable from an ordinary cloak of the same color.
However, when worn with the hood drawn up around the head, the
wearer becomes nearly invisible, granting an 80% chance that
the wearer can move about unnoticed. If detected by onlookers,
the wearer can be attacked without significant penalty.

Flying Carpet: This rug is able to fly through the air on
command. A flying carpet is typically 5' x 8' in size and can
carry up to 500 pounds at a movement rate of 100' per round, or
up to 1000 pounds (its maximum capacity) at a rate of 50' per
round. A flying carpet can fly at any speed up to its maximum,
and can hover on command.

Gauntlets of Ogre Power: These gauntlets are made of tough
leather with iron studs running across the back of the hands
and fingers. They grant the wearer a Strength bonus of +4
(instead of his or her own Strength bonus). Both gauntlets must
be worn for the magic to be effective.

Girdle of Giant Strength: This item grants the wearer the
Strength of a giant. For so long as it is worn, the wearer
gains a Strength bonus of +5 (instead of his or her own
Strength bonus), and can throw large stones just as a stone
giant does.

Helm of Reading Languages and Magic: Appearing as a normal
helmet, this helm grants its wearer the ability to understand
the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any
language and any magical writing. Note that the limitations
described under the spell read languages apply to this device
also. Understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply
spell use.

Helm of Telepathy: The wearer can read the surface thoughts of a
target creature within 90' as if using the spell ESP.
Furthermore, he or she can send a telepathic message to anyone
whose surface thoughts are thus being read (allowing two-way
communication). This helm may be used up to three times per
day.

Helm of Teleportation: A character wearing this device may
teleport three times per day, exactly as if he or she had cast
the spell of the same name.

Horn of Blasting: This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It
can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is
spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 2d6 points
of damage to creatures within a cone 40' long and 40' wide at
the far end, and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds.
Affected creatures may save vs. Death Ray, taking half damage
and avoiding deafness if the save is made. Crystalline
creatures take double damage. Nonliving creatures are generally
immune to deafness, but still suffer damage as described.

If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a
given day, there is a 10% cumulative chance with each extra use
that it explodes and deals 3d6 points of damage to the person
sounding it.

The horn can also be used to damage or destroy buildings,
fortifications, etc. Double the damage listed above when a horn
of blasting is used against a structure. The Stronghold rules in
the Game Master section contains further guidance on this.

Horn of Doom: When blown, this horn will create animated
skeletons or zombies as if by the spell animate dead. Up to 3d6
hit dice of undead monsters will be so created from remains
within a 60' radius of the character who blew the horn. If both
skeletal and fleshy remains are available in the area of effect,
skeletons will be animated in preference over zombies. If the
user is a magic-user or cleric, the created undead may be
controlled so long as that character retains the horn. If blown
by a fighter or thief, the undead created will be uncontrolled.
Uncontrolled undead monsters will attack any living creatures
nearby. The horn may be used once per day, but no more than 18
hit dice of undead created by the horn may exist at any one
time.

Medallion of ESP: This appears to be a normal pendant disk hung
from a neck chain. Usually fashioned from bronze, copper, or
nickel-silver, the medallion allows the wearer to read the
thoughts of others, as with the spell ESP. It can be used as
many times per day as desired, but each such usage requires a
minimum of 1 round of full concentration to activate, and the
wearer must continue to concentrate to maintain the effect.

Mirror of Life Trapping: This crystal device is usually about 4
feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or
placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command
word. Only a Magic-User can properly control this device. The
same command word deactivates the mirror. The character who
activates the device is immune to it. The mirror has twenty
extradimensional cells within it; any creature coming within
30' of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a
save vs. Spells or be trapped within the mirror in one of the
cells.

[-- Image: graphics89 --]When a creature is trapped, it is taken
bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and
undead are not trapped. A victim’s equipment (including clothing
and anything being carried) is taken also. The mirror’s owner
can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its
surface and engage the powerless prisoner in conversation. He
or she can also free any trapped creature by verbal command.

If the mirror’s capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined
randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one.
If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it
are freed.

Rope of Climbing: This 50' long rope is no thicker than a wand,
but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command,
the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other
direction at 10' per round, attaching itself securely wherever
its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the
same manner. The rope must have something to tie itself to in
order to support weight other than its own. One end of the rope
must be held by the user when its magic is invoked.

Scarab of Protection: This device appears to be a silver
medallion in the shape of a beetle. The scarab absorbs
energy-draining attacks, death effects, and curses. Upon
absorbing 2d6 such attacks, the scarab crumbles to dust and is
destroyed.

Stone Commanding Earth Elementals: A stone of this nature is
typically an oddly shaped piece of roughly polished rock. The
possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of
summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner and
follows the commands of the summoner (as described for the
Elemental monster entry). The summoning words require 1 full
round to speak. Only one such elemental can be called per day.

PART 8: GAME MASTER INFORMATION

Wandering Monsters

We had the foresight to bring several large sacks with us, and
we swiftly filled them with coins and gems from beneath the
sarcophagus. Without further delay we moved out, intent upon
reaching the stairs to the surface and then returning to
Morgansfort. But it couldn't be that easy…

On the way in, Barthal scouted ahead and we took our time,
constantly on the lookout for monsters. On the way out, we
threw caution to the wind, moving at full speed with Barthal
watching behind us. So it was that Morningstar and I turned a
corner and practically stepped on the first rank of a goblin
patrol!

Once again I was caught flatfooted, but so were the goblins.
Morningstar reacted more swiftly, striking down the first of
the little monsters. You might think that parley would have
been a better idea, but we had already tried that with these
goblins without success… so I couldn't blame the Elf for
striking first and asking questions later.

I raised the golden sword and waded into battle…

Dungeon Encounters

Besides “placed” monsters, dungeons usually contain wandering
monsters. The Game Master may create special wandering monster
tables for specific dungeons, or the general wandering monster
tables (below) may be used.

In an average dungeon, a wandering monster encounter will occur
on a roll of 1 on 1d6; the Game Master should check once every
3 turns. The circumstances of a specific dungeon may call for
higher odds or more frequent (or possibly less frequent)
wandering monster checks.

Wilderness Encounters

The Game Master should check for random encounters in the
wilderness about every four hours of game time; this translates
nicely to three night checks and three daytime checks. If your
players choose to stand three night watches, you simply check
for each watch; in the daytime, check morning, afternoon, and
evening.

To check for a wilderness encounter, roll 1d6; on a roll of 1,
an encounter occurs. If a wilderness encounter is indicated,
roll 2d8 on the appropriate table below. The Game Master should
think carefully about how the encounter happens; check for
surprise in advance, and if the monster is not surprised, it
may be considered to have had time to set up an ambush (at the
GM's option).

City, Town or Village Encounters

It's important for the Game Master to remember that, unlike
dungeon or wilderness environments, cities, towns and villages
are busy places. During the day, most towns will have people on
the streets more or less all the time; the absence of people on
the streets is often an indication of something interesting. By
night, much of the town will be dark and quiet, and encounters
will be mostly Thieves or other unsavory types; but near
popular eating (or drinking) establishments, people of all
sorts are still likely to be encountered. The GM must make sure
that his or her descriptions of the town environment make this
clear; of course, this will also make it harder for the players
to identify “real” encounters.

[-- Image: graphics65 --]The GM is encouraged to create his or
her own encounter tables for use in each city, town or village
created (or assign encounters by other means if desired);
however, a set of “generic” encounter tables are provided below
for those times when such preparation has not been completed.
Roll 2d6 on the table below to determine what sort of encounter
occurs; a description of each type of encounter appears below
the table.

Beggar encounters will often begin with a single beggar
approaching the party, but there will generally be 2d4 beggars
in the area, and if any party member gives anything to the
first beggar, the others will descend on the party like flies.
Each beggar is 90% likely to be a normal man, and 10% likely to
be a 1st level Thief, possibly scouting for the Thieves Guild or
a local gang.

Bully encounters will be with 2d4 young toughs; each is 70%
likely to be a normal man, 30% likely to be a 1st level
Fighter. Bullies generally appear unarmed, depending on their
brawling ability in a fight (but keeping a dagger or shortsword
hidden, to be used in case the fight is going against them).
Bullies can be a bit unpredictable, such that the GM may want
to use a reaction roll to determine the leader's mood.

City Watch encounters will be with 2d6 watchmen, all 1st level
Fighters save for the squad leader, who will be from 2nd
through 4th level. They will confront “suspicious-looking”
characters, but generally will need a good reason before they
attempt to arrest or otherwise interfere with player
characters.

Doppleganger encounters will, of course, appear to be some other
type of encounter; the GM should roll again to determine what
the doppleganger is masquerading as. 1d6 dopplegangers will be
encountered; any extra group members will be humans who do not
know they are traveling in the company of shapeshifting
monsters. If the party is “interesting” to the dopplegangers,
one or more of the monsters will attempt to follow them and
replace a party member (as described in the monster
description). In many cases, player character parties will not
discover the true nature of the encounter until much later.

Giant Rat encounters will generally involve alleys, the docks,
or other “low” places. Rats are generally not dangerous unless
provoked, but if surprised they may attack. See the monster
description for details of this encounter type.

Lycanthrope, Wererat encounters will appear to be some other
type of encounter, either another sort of “normal” encounter or
a giant rat encounter (depending on the circumstances). Wererats
are cowardly and will not attack a party of equal or larger
size.

Mercenary encounters will involve 2d6 members of a mercenary
company, going about some business or other. A mercenary leader
may offer a position to Fighter-classed player characters if
they have any reputation at all.

Merchants are a common feature of towns, and may be encountered
performing any sort of business. As with mercenary encounters,
merchants may offer jobs to interesting player characters,
particularly those with good reputations. See Creating an NPC
Party, below, for details on this type of encounter. (A
merchant in a town may not have a full entourage as described
below; the GM should use his or her discretion in creating the
encounter.)

Nobles encountered may also offer positions to player
characters, or possibly offer a reward for some dangerous task.
Player characters with bad reputations may be confronted,
ordered to leave town, or even arrested if the noble is able to
call for the city watch. (See Creating an NPC Party, below, for
details on this type of encounter.) A noble in a town may not
have a full entourage as described below; the GM should use his
or her discretion in creating the encounter.

Press Gangs will consist of 2d6 Fighters, all 1st level except
for one or two leaders of 2nd through 5th level. They will be
armed with blunt weapons or possibly will fight with their bare
hands, since their goal is to capture rather than kill player
characters; however, it is likely that at least some members of
a press gang will have daggers or swords on their persons in
case a serious fight breaks out. A press gang will not confront
a party of equal or greater size unless the party is obviously
weakened, drunk, etc. If the party loses, they will awaken
aboard a ship at sea or in a military camp (depending on
whether sailors or soldiers captured them), unarmed and at the
mercy of their captors.

Priest encounters will usually be similar to a group of pilgrims
(see Creating an NPC Party, below, for details), though the
group encountered will not be as large as would be encountered
in the wilderness. Generally, a single priest of 1st through
4th level will be encountered, accompanied by 1d4 of the
faithful.

Shadow encounters in a town will be much like the same encounter
underground; see the monster description for details.

Thief encounters will be with a group of 1d6 Thieves, generally
disguised as ordinary townsmen or sometimes as beggars. One
Thief in the group will be from 2nd to 4th level, with the
others being 1st level only. They will seek to steal from the
party, of course, unless watched very carefully.

Wizard encounters will involve a Magic-User of 4th through 7th
level, accompanied by 1d4-1 apprentices of 1st level. The GM
must decide on the temperament and mood of the wizard.

Creating An NPC Party

Adventurers

[-- Image: graphics81 --]A party of NPC adventurers will usually
consist of 4-8 characters, as follows: 1d3 Fighters, 1d2
Thieves, 1d2 Clerics, and 1d2-1 Magic-Users. Usually the
characters will all be of similar levels; after deciding what
average level the party should be, you may wish to make a few
of the characters lower levels (to reflect the usual
“replacements” brought in when some characters die).

The Game Master must choose the race(s) of the NPC adventurers
to suit the region they are found in (or come from). Probably
80% or more of adventurers are Human, 10% are Dwarves, 6% are
Halfling and the remaining 4% Elvish. If the NPC adventurer
party is evil, the GM may choose to replace some party members
with humanoid monsters such as orcs, hobgoblins, or gnolls.

The party may be rivals with the player characters, vying for
the same treasures, or they may actually be enemies, evil
marauders that the player characters must defeat. It is, of
course, possible that the NPC adventurers are allied or
otherwise friendly with the player characters, but this may
make things too easy for the players.

Bandits, Brigands, and Highwaymen

A party of bandits will generally consist of 2d12 1st level
Fighters and 1d6 1st level Thieves, led by a Fighter or Thief
of 2nd to 5th level (1d4+1) or by one of each class (if there
are 11 or more 1st level members total). In the wilderness,
bandits will generally have horses or other steeds appropriate
to the terrain (stolen, of course) as well as light armor,
swords and bows or crossbows. Determine magic items as given
below for the leaders only; rank-and-file members will not
normally have magic items.

In their lair or hideout, a party of bandits will generally have
type A treasure (with magic items omitted since they will have
already been generated using the rules below).

Buccaneers and Pirates

[-- Image: graphics78 --]The difference between buccaneers and
pirates is largely a question of what they wish to be called;
whatever you call them, they are waterborne equivalents of
bandits, attacking other ships or raiding coastal towns for
plunder.

A buccaneer party will consist of 3d8 1st level Fighters, led by
a Fighter of 3rd to 6th level (1d4+2) and 1d3 Fighters of 2nd to
5th level. All will be experienced at handling ships, of course.
They will be unarmored or armored only in leather, and will be
armed with swords and bows or crossbows.

Seagoing pirates may appear in larger numbers, but the number of
leader-types will be similar to that given above. Generate magic
items for leaders only as described below. A shipload of pirates
or buccaneers will have a type A treasure, with magic items
omitted (since magic items will already have been rolled for
the NPCs); the treasure may not be aboard the ship, however, as
pirates often prefer to bury their treasures on islands. In such
a case, the Captain or one of his mates will have a treasure map
leading to the location of the treasure.

Merchants

Merchants must often transport their wares through wilderness
areas. Roughly half of the time (50%), a land-bound merchant
party will be led by a single wealthy merchant; other merchant
parties will consist of 1d4+1 less wealthy merchants who have
banded together for their own safety. There will be 2d4 wagons
(but at least one per merchant) drawn by horses or mules. Each
wagon is driven by a teamster who is a normal man, usually
unarmored and armed with a dagger or shortsword. The caravan
will employ 1d4+2 first-level Fighters and 1d4 second-level
Fighters as guards.

If encountered at sea, a merchant party will generally consist
of a single ship owned or rented by a single merchant. The ship
will have a crew of 2d8+8 regular crewmen, who are normal men,
unarmored and armed with clubs, daggers or shortswords; the
Captain, First Mate, and other officers are taken from this
number. Large ships may require larger crews. 1d4+2 first-level
Fighters and 1d4 second-level Fighters will be aboard as guards,
just as with a caravan.

Besides the valuable but undoubtedly bulky trade goods
transported by the merchant caravan or ship, such a party will
also have a type A treasure, with magic items omitted; it may
be in one chest, or spread out among the wagons.

Nobles

A noble party will consist of a noble (of course), possibly
accompanied by a spouse (also a noble, of course) and/or one or
more children. Each adult noble will have at least one attendant
(assistant, lady-in-waiting, etc.).

Lower-ranking nobles (such as barons) will have a single wagon
or carriage, drawn by fine horses; higher-ranking nobles will
have two or more wagons. The noble may be mounted on a
warhorse, though he or she may choose to ride in a carriage
part of the time. Each carriage or wagon will have a teamster,
who in this case will be a 1st level Fighter in chainmail with
a longsword. At least two mounted Fighters of 1st through 4th
level will be with the noble as guards; again, higher ranking
nobles will have more guards. Guards will generally be armed
with longswords and possibly lances, armored in platemail, and
their warhorses will usually be barded with chainmail.
Determining the exact number of guards is left to the GM in
this case. The normal chances for magic items apply, of course.

A noble will usually be traveling with a little spending money;
a type A treasure should be rolled to represent this. In this
case, do not omit the magic items, as nobles will generally be
more wealthy than the average party of men.

Nobles are usually (70%) normal men; otherwise, roll 1d10: 1-6
indicates a Fighter, 7-8 indicates a Magic-User, 9 indicates a
Cleric, and 10 indicates a Thief. (Clerical “nobles” are
bishops, archbishops, and the like.) Roll 2d4-1 for the level
of each “classed” noble.

Pilgrims

A party of pilgrims is on its way to (or from) a major religious
locale or activity. Such a party will be led by a 1d4 Clerics of
level 1-4 (roll for each).

The remainder of the party is rather random in nature; most
pilgrim groups include 3d6 normal men (or women if the religion
allows women to go on pilgrimages), 1d6 Fighters of level 1-4
(roll for each) with chainmail and longsword, and 1d4 Thieves
of level 1-4 (each of whom may be a genuine devout person, or
possibly just on the lam). There is also a 50% chance of a
single Magic-User of level 1-4 being with the party.

Pilgrims usually travel light, carrying a single bag each and
walking or riding mules or horses. The pilgrim party will most
likely be bringing offerings of some sort to their destination;
generate a type A treasure for this purpose. If magic items are
indicated, they will most likely not be used by any of the NPCs
as they have already been dedicated to the god or pantheon.

Magic Items for NPCs

[-- Image: Image23 --]NPCs will generally have magic items in
proportion to their class and level; assume a 5% chance per
level that any given Fighter, Thief or Cleric NPC will have a
magic weapon or magic armor (roll for weapon and armor
separately for each NPC). Regardless of level, a roll of 96-00
should be considered a failure. Magic-Users will have a Ring of
Protection (roll the bonus as usual for the item) on a roll of
4% per level, and a magic dagger or walking staff on a roll of
3% per level.

In addition, assume a 2% per level chance that any given
character will have a potion, and 3% per level that a Cleric or
Magic-User will have a scroll of some sort.

Finally, add up the levels of all members of the party, and use
this number as a percentage chance that a Miscellaneous Magic
item will be found among them. If the roll is made, divide the
number by two and roll again; if the second roll is made, two
such items are found. If the party has more than 3 members, you
might wish to divide the number in half again and roll for a
third such item. Assign the Miscellaneous Magic item or items
to whichever party members seem most appropriate, or roll
randomly if you can't decide.

Demi-Human Parties

It is assumed above that NPC parties will be Human, or
predominantly so; but the Game Master may choose to present
parties of Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings from time to time. In
general, a party of demi-humans will be homogeneous…. an Elf
party would consist of all Elves, for instance. If encountered
in the territory of another race, the demi-human party might
include a guide hired to lead them to their destination. For
example, the Elf party mentioned above might hire a Human guide
to help them when traveling through a Human country.

The Game Master may simply use the figures given above when
generating such parties. One thing that the GM must decide is
whether or not the “normal men” rules apply to demi-humans… are
there “normal elves” for instance? This decision is left to the
GM. If there are such characters, they will have the same
racial abilities as others of their race, but will fight with
an Attack Bonus of +0 just as normal men do. If there are no
such characters in the campaign world, then simply substitute
1st level Fighters for the normal men listed above.

Dealing with Players

Character Creation Options

The standard character creation rules call for rolling 3d6 for
each Ability Score in order. Players may complain that they
can't create the sort of characters they want to play. Here are
several options you may choose from if you wish to make things
easier for your players. Note that the players must not be
allowed to demand these options; it's purely the decision of
the Game Master.

Point Swapping: Allow the player to “move” points from one
Ability Score to another, at a rate of -2 to one score for each
+1 added to the other. The maximum score is still 18 (or the
racial maximum if lower), and the player should not be allowed
to lower any score below 9.

Score Swapping: Let the player exchange any two Ability Scores,
once per character.

The Full Shuffle: Let the player arrange the six Ability Score
values as he or she wishes. This allows the most customization
for the player, but on the other hand you may find that all
player characters in your campaign begin to look very much
alike. It's not uncommon for players to “dump” the lowest
statistic in Charisma, for instance.

Hopeless Characters

Sometimes a player will look at the six scores rolled, and
declare the character “hopeless.” The Game Master should always
allow the player to scrap a character with less than 9 in the
first four scores (since all four classes would be unavailable
to that character). However, you as the Game Master might
choose to allow the player to reroll a character with scores
that are overall below average even if the character isn't as
“hopeless” as this.

Here's a suggestion: Sum up the Ability Score bonuses or
penalties that apply to the character. If the total is
negative, consider the character below average, and allow the
player to scratch the entire set of scores and reroll. If the
total is zero, the character is “average,” and the player
probably should go ahead and play the character as rolled.
Obviously, if the total is greater than zero, the character
should be played as rolled.

As an alternative, a player who rolls a set of ability scores
where the total of all the bonuses and penalties is negative
may be allowed to "flip" the scores by subtracting all the
scores (not just the "bad" ones) from 21. This makes a 3 into
an 18, for example, and will result in a total of bonuses and
penalties that is positive if the total was previously
negative.

Acquisition of Spells

Clerics have an obvious advantage over Magic-Users, in that, in
theory, they have access to any spell of any level which they
can cast. However, note that Clerics are limited in their spell
selection based on their deity, faith or ethos; for instance, a
Cleric of the goddess of healing should not be surprised that
his or her deity refuses to grant reversed healing spells. If a
Cleric prays for a spell that is not allowed, the Game Master
may choose to grant the character a different spell, or
optionally (if the deity is angered) no spell at all for that
“slot.”

Magic-Users begin play knowing two spells, read magic plus one
other (unless the GM grants more starting spells). Each time
the character gains a level, he or she gains the ability to
cast more spells; in addition, every other level the Magic-User
gains access to the next higher level spells (until all levels
are available). However, gaining the ability to cast these
spells does not necessarily mean the Magic-User instantly
learns new spells.

Magic-Users may learn spells by being taught by another
Magic-User, or by studying another Magic-User's spellbook. If
being taught, a spell can be learned in a single day;
researching another Magic-User's spellbook takes one day per
spell level. In either case, the spell learned must be
transcribed into the Magic-User's own spellbook, at a cost of
500 gp per spell level transcribed.

A Magic-User may add a new spell of any level he or she may cast
at any point; however, spells of higher levels may not be
learned or added to the Magic-User's spellbook. The Magic-User
must find a teacher or acquire a reference work (such as
another Magic-User's spellbook) in order to learn new spells,
and the cost of such is in addition to the costs given above.
Often a Magic-User will maintain a relationship with his or her
original master, who will teach the character new spells either
for free or in return for services. Sometimes two Magic-Users
will agree to exchange known spells. In many cases the only
option available to a Magic-User will be to pay another
Magic-User (often an NPC) anywhere from 100 gp to 1000 gp per
spell level in return for such training.

Magic-Users may also create entirely new spells (or alter
existing spells); see the Magic Research rules, below, for
details.

Weapon and Armor Restrictions

Several races and classes have weapon and/or armor restrictions
applied to them. What happens when a player declares that his
or her character is going to use a prohibited weapon or wear
prohibited armor?

Clerics: The prohibition against edged weapons is a matter of
faith for Clerics. Therefore, if a Cleric uses a prohibited
weapon, he or she immediately loses access to his or her spells
as well as the power to Turn the Undead. A higher-level NPC
Cleric of the same faith must assign some quest to the
miscreant which must be completed in order for the fallen
Cleric to atone and regain his or her powers. If unrepentant,
the character is changed permanently from a Cleric to a
Fighter. Refigure the character's level, applying the current
XP total to the Fighter table to determine this. Hit points and
attack bonus remain the same; change the attack bonus only after
a new level is gained as a Fighter, and roll Fighter hit dice as
normal when levels are gained.

Magic-Users: These characters are simply untrained in any weapon
other than those normally allowed to them, and should suffer a
-5 attack penalty when using any prohibited weapon. A
Magic-User in armor can't cast spells at all; any such attempt
fails, and the spell is lost.

Thieves: Wearing armor heavier, more restrictive and/or noisier
than leather armor prevents the use of any Thief ability,
including the Sneak Attack ability. Thieves may choose to wear
such armor, but this only makes them a poor excuse for a
Fighter.

Dwarves and Halflings: These characters are prohibited from
using large weapons, mainly due to their small stature and
relatively low weight. It's hard to swing a weapon when the
weapon is trying to swing you. If such a character tries to use
a prohibited weapon, the Game Master may either apply a -5
attack penalty based on the difficulty of using the weapon, or
alternately declare the attempt unsuccessful, at his or her
option.

Judging Wishes

Wishes are one of the most potentially unbalancing things in the
game. With a carefully worded wish, a player character can make
sweeping, dramatic changes in the game world, possibly even
rewriting history. Before allowing the player characters in
your game access to even one wish, think about how you will
deal with it.

Wishes are granted by a variety of beings. Even when a wish
comes from a device (a ring or a sword, for instance), some
extradimensional being, god or devil or whatever, has placed
that wish in the device. A wish will tend to further the goals
of the granting being; if the granter is an evil efreeti, for
instance, it will attempt to twist the meaning or intent of the
wish so that it does not really accomplish what the player
character wants. On the other hand, if the granter is one of
the good powers, it will grant the wish as intended so long at
the player character isn't being greedy or spiteful.

Game balance is the main issue that must be considered. Using a
wish to heal the entire party, teleport everyone without error
to a distant location, or to avoid or redo a catastrophic
battle, is reasonable. A wish that a character be restored to
life and health is reasonable, but a wish that not only
restores but also improves the character is not.

In general, a wish is granted with at least literal accuracy…
the words of the wish must be fulfilled. The exception is
wishes that are unreasonable for game balance purposes; they
are still at least literally interpreted, but may be only
partially granted. In the last example above, for instance, the
granting power would likely restore the character to life and
health but ignore the “improvements” wished for.

Optional Rules

Death and Dying

The rules state that, at zero hit points, the character is dead.
If this is too harsh for you, here are several approaches to
changing the situation:

Raise Dead: The first approach doesn't change the rules a bit.
Arrange matters so that characters killed in an adventure can
be easily raised (but at a substantial cost). This not only
“deals” with the mortality issue, it also soaks up excess
treasure, preventing the player characters from becoming too
rich to be interested in adventuring. It also tends to reward
the cautious (since they get to keep their gold more often).

What if the characters don't have enough money when they die to
afford to be raised? Allow the local religious establishment to
raise dead adventurers in return for their indenture… that is,
the adventurers, upon being restored to life, owe the church or
temple the money it would have cost to be raised, or an
equivalent service. Thus, the local religious leaders would
have a ready pool of adventurers to undertake dangerous
missions for them.

But the adventurer(s) are dead… how can they agree to the
indenture? There are two options: the priests can use speak
with dead to attain agreement, or the adventurers can sign an
agreement with the church before leaving on the potentially
dangerous adventure. The latter might even be considered a
standard procedure in some places.

Save vs. Death: The first actual rule alteration is to allow
characters reduced to zero hit points to save vs. Death Ray to
avoid death. If the save is failed, the character is
immediately dead, just as in the normal rules. If the save is
made, the character remains alive for 2d10 rounds; if the
character's wounds are bound (or he or she receives healing
magic) within this time frame, death is averted. The character
remains unconscious for the full 2d10 rounds rolled, either
dying if left untreated or awakening if his or her wounds are
bound.

Binding the wounds of the dying character stabilizes him or her
at zero hit points. Non-magical healing will require a full
week to restore the first hit point; after this, healing
proceeds at the normal rate.

Magical healing will restore the character to whatever total is
rolled on the healing die roll (up to the usual maximum of
course).

Note that any spellcaster reduced to zero hit points who
subsequently survives loses all remaining prepared spells.

This rule might be combined with the suggestions under Raise
Dead, above.

Negative Hit Points: Instead of stopping at zero hit points,
keep track of the current negative figure. At the end of each
round after he or she falls, the character loses an additional
hit point. If a total of -10 is reached, the character is dead.
Before this point is reached, the character may have his or her
wounds bound and/or receive magical healing, which will
stabilize the character. The injured character may not move
more than a few feet without help, nor fight, nor cast spells,
until his or her hit points are again greater than zero. This
rule should not be combined with the Save vs. Death option.

Just as with the Save vs. Death rule, spellcasters who survive
being reduced to zero or negative hit points lose all currently
prepared spells.

As a further option, the GM may choose to use a negative number
equal to the character's Constitution score rather than a
straight -10.

“Save or Die” Poison

[-- Image: graphics80 --]Poisons, as described in the Encounter
and Monster sections, kill characters instantly. Game Masters
may find this makes the mortality rate of player characters a
bit too high. On the other hand, poisons should be scary.
Here's an optional rule which may make things a bit easier
without entirely removing the fear from poison:

Where a “save or die” poison is indicated, the victim must make
a save vs. Poison or suffer 1d6 damage per round for 6 rounds,
starting the round following the exposure to the poison; this
is an average of 21 points of damage, but even a first level
character might survive with a combination of luck and healing
magic. The GM may create poisons which vary from these figures,
of course. If the Negative Hit Points optional rule is being
used, it is suggested to increase the poison duration to 10
rounds (an average 35 points).

Awarding Experience Points for Treasure Gained

[-- Image: Image19 --]The Game Master may also assign experience
points for treasure gained, at a rate of 1 GP = 1 XP. This is
optional; GMs wishing to advance their players to higher levels
more quickly may choose to do this, while those preferring a
more leisurely pace should omit it. If experience is awarded
for treasure, it should be awarded only for treasure acquired
and returned to a place of safety. Alternately, the GM may
require treasure to be spent on training in order to count it
for experience. This is a highly effective way to remove excess
treasure from the campaign.

Ability Rolls

There will be times when a player character tries to do
something in the game that seems to have no rule covering it.
In some of those cases, the only attribute the PC has that
seems appropriate may be an Ability Score. Here is a suggested
method for making rolls against Ability Scores that still gives
better odds to higher level characters:

The player rolls 1d20 and adds his or her Ability Bonus for the
score the GM thinks is most appropriate, as well as any
situational bonus or penalty the GM assigns. Consult the
following table. If the total rolled is equal to or higher than
the given Target number, the roll is a success.

Preparing Spells from Memory

Sometimes a Magic-User will want to prepare spells, but his or
her spellbook may be unavailable; this includes when the book
has been destroyed or stolen as well as times when the
Magic-User has been captured or trapped.

A Magic-User can always prepare read magic from memory. Other
spells require an Intelligence ability roll, as described
above, with the spell level as a penalty on the die roll.

Failure exhausts the spell slot being prepared, just as if it
had been successfully prepared and then cast; so if a 5th level
Magic-User attempts to prepare fireball from memory, and fails,
he or she will have no 3rd level spells for the day.

Thief Abilities

Some players of Thieves may wish to have more control over their
Thief abilities. If you study the Thief Abilities table, you'll
discover its secret: from levels 2-9, the Thief improves 30
percentiles (total) each level; from levels 10-15, 20
percentiles; and from level 16 on, 10 percentiles. If you wish
to allow Thief customization, simply let the player allocate
these points as he or she wishes rather than following the
table. Allow no more than 10 percentiles to be added to any
single Thief ability per level gain. Note also that no Thief
ability may be raised above 99 percent.

Magical Research

General Rules for Research

At some point a Magic-User or Cleric may wish to start creating
magic items or inventing spells. This is termed magical
research. For any research, Magic-User must have a tower or
laboratory, while a Cleric requires a properly consecrated
temple or church of his or her faith. In addition, there will
be a cost for the creation of each item, a minimum time
required to create it, and a given chance of success. If the
roll fails, generally the time and money are wasted and the
procedure must be started again from the beginning; however,
consult the detailed rules below for exceptions.

In almost all cases, the Game Master should make this roll in
secret. There are many situations where the character (or the
player) should not know whether the roll has actually failed,
or whether the GM has decided the research is impossible for
the character. The GM may decide to tell the player that the
research is impossible if the roll succeeds; if the roll is a
failure, that is all the player should be told.

In general, Clerics may only create magic items reproducing the
effects of Clerical spells; Clerics may also make enchanted
weapons and armor, even those sorts which they may not use
themselves (since they may be creating weapons or armor for
other followers of their faith). Magic-Users may create any
sort of magic item except for those reproducing Clerical spells
for which no equivalent Magic-User spell exists.

Time spent doing magical research must be eight-hour workdays
with interruptions lasting no more than two days. Longer
interruptions result in automatic failure of the project.

The GM may, if he or she so desires, grant Experience Points to
characters who successfully complete magical research. It is
suggested that the rate of such awards be 1 XP per 10 gp spent
on the research. This award may be granted for all research, or
only for creation of magic items, or not at all if the GM
prefers to emphasize adventuring for advancement purposes.

Spell Research

Researching new spells is the most common type of magical
research. A Magic-User may research a standard spell, removing
the need for a teacher or reference; alternately, a Cleric or
Magic-User may research an entirely new spell. Of course, no
character may invent or research a spell of a level higher than
he or she can cast.

If the character is inventing a spell outright, the GM must
determine the spell's level and judge whether or not the spell
is possible “as is.” The GM does not have to tell the player
whether the spell is possible, and in fact this may be
preferable.

The cost to research a spell is 1,000 gp per spell level for
“standard” spells, or 2,000 gp per spell level for newly
invented spells; in either case, one week is required per spell
level to complete the research. The chance of success is 25%,
plus 5% per level of the character, minus 10% per level of the
spell; the maximum chance of success is 95%.

If the research roll is successful, the character may add the
spell to his or her spellbook (if a Magic-User) or may
subsequently pray for the spell (if a Cleric). On a failure,
the money and time are spent to no avail. Clerics of the same
deity, faith or ethos may teach each other the prayers required
to access new spells; this takes one hour per spell level. The
procedure to exchange spells with other Magic-Users has already
been explained (under Acquisition of Spells, above).

As mentioned above, the GM may decide that a proposed new spell
is not “correct” for his or her campaign; too powerful, too low
in level, etc. Rather than tell the player this, there are two
strategies that may be used.

First, the Game Master may decide to revise the spell. If the
roll is a success, the GM then presents the player with a
revised writeup of the spell, adjusted however the GM feels
necessary for game balance purposes.

The alternative, more appropriate when the GM believes the spell
should be higher level than the player character can cast, is to
make the roll anyway. If the roll fails, that is all the player
needs to know; but if it succeeds, the GM should then show the
player the revised version of the spell and explain that the
character may try again when he or she attains a high enough
level to cast it. In this case, the GM may allow the character
to reduce either the time or the cost by half when the research
is attempted again at the higher level.

Magic Item Research

Any character who wishes to create magical items must know all
(if any) spells to be imbued in the item. Items that produce
effects not matching any known spell may require additional
research (to devise the unknown spell) if the GM so desires.

Some magic items require one or more special components that
cannot usually be bought. Special components can only be used
once on such a project. For example, the GM might require the
skin of a displacer to create a cloak of displacement, or red
dragon saliva to create a wand of fireballs. Note that there
are specific rules for components under Other Magic Items,
below.

Special component requirements are entirely at the option of the
Game Master, and are usually employed to slow the creation of
powerful magic items that might tend to unbalance the campaign.
It's also a good way to lead the spellcaster (and his party)
into dangerous adventures.

Chance of Success

Unless given differently below, the base chance of success
creating a magic item is 15% plus 5% per level of the
spellcaster, plus the spellcaster's full Intelligence (if a
Magic-User) or Wisdom (if a Cleric). Thus, a 9th level
spellcaster with a 15 Prime Requisite has a base chance of 75%.

Spell Scrolls

A spellcaster may create a scroll containing any spell he or she
has access to (for a Magic-User, spells in his or her spellbook;
for a Cleric, any spell the character might successfully pray
for). The cost is 500 gp per spell level, and the time required
is 1 day per spell level.

Reduce the chance of success based on the level of the spell
being inscribed, at a rate of -10% per level.

If the roll fails, the enchantment of the scroll has failed;
however, if the caster tries again to inscribe the same spell,
either the cost or the time is reduced by half (at the
character's option).

Other Single-Use Items

Scrolls (other than spell scrolls), potions, and a few other
items (such as the rod of cancellation) are single-use items.
These items may be created by Magic-Users or Clerics of the 7th
level or higher.

The chance of success is as given for scrolls, above, when the
item being created reproduces a known spell (or when the GM
decides a spell must be created, as described above). For other
types of items, the GM should assign a spell level as he or she
sees fit, and the cost and time required is doubled (making up
for the spell research or knowledge required for
spell-reproducing items). The time required is one week plus
one day per spell level (or equivalent), and the cost to
enchant the item is 50 gp per spell level, per day.

Potions are a special case; the character creating a potion may
create a large batch, consisting of several doses, which may be
bottled in separate vials or combined in a larger flask. For
each additional dose created at the same time, reduce the
chance of success by 5% and increase the time required by one
day. Note that increasing the time required will directly
increase the cost. If the roll to create the item fails, the
entire batch is spoiled.

Permanent Magic Items

Creating permanent magic items (rings, weapons, wands, staves,
and most miscellaneous magic items) requires a Magic-User or
Cleric of the 9th level or higher.

When enchanting an item with multiple abilities, each ability of
the item requires a separate roll for success; the first failed
roll ends the enchantment process. Such an item will still
perform the powers or effects already successfully enchanted
into it, but no further enchantment is possible.

Permanent magic items, including weapons (described in detail
below), must be created from high-quality items. The cost of
such items will generally be ten times the normal cost for such
an item.

Enchanting Weapons

The base cost of enchanting a weapon or armor is 1,000 gp per
point of bonus. For weapons with two bonuses, divide the larger
bonus in half (don't round) and add the smaller bonus; thus, a
sword +1, +3 vs. dragons would cost 2,500 gp to enchant.
Enchanting a weapon takes one week plus two days per point of
bonus; thus, the sword described would require twelve days to
enchant.

Reduce the chance of success by 10% times the bonus; so, a sword
+1 would reduce the base chance 10%, while the sword +1, +3 vs.
dragons described above would reduce the base chance 25%.
Further, the chance of success may be increased 25% by doubling
the cost and time required (this decision must be announced
before the roll is made).

For weapons having additional powers, combine the rules above
with the rules for creating permanent items. All enchantments
must be applied in a single enchantment “session.”

Other Magic Items

Magic items can have several features. Each feature added to a
magic item increases the cost and the time required, and
decreases the chance of success. The features are as follows:

Creates a spell or spell-like effect: This is the basic feature
of all non-weapon magic items. The base cost of this
enchantment is 500 gp per spell level; time required is five
days plus two days per level. If the magic item has multiple
spell or spell-like effects, add the cost and time figures
together. The chance of success is reduced 5% per spell level.

Has multiple charges: This includes, of course, wands and
staffs, but several other magic items would also have charges.
Each spell or spell-like effect normally has a separate pool of
charges (but see next). The table below shows the various
maximum charge levels and the associated cost, time and chance
adjustments:

Charge Level

Cost per Charge

Charges per Day

Chance

2-3

+150 gp

1

- 5%

4-7

+125 gp

2

- 10%

8-20

+100 gp

3

- 20%

21-30

+75 gp

4

- 30%

When using the table above, don't count the first charge for
cost or time purposes. Note that each separate pool of charges
in the item must be figured separately.

Item can be recharged: Figure the additional cost and time, and
the penalty to the chance of success, for rechargeable items as
being exactly twice the figures from the table above; so,
creating a rechargeable item with 3 charges costs 600 gp more
rather than 300 gp more, and takes two days per charge (or four
extra days); the chance of success is lowered 10% rather than
5%.

Item recharges itself: Creating a self-recharging item is
expensive; apply the following adjustments to the charge cost,
time and chance for items that recharge automatically. Note
that self-recharging items are never “rechargeable” in that
they may not be recharged other than by themselves.

Charging Rate

Cost

Time

Chance

1 per day

x 3

x 2

- 10%

All per day

x 5

x 3

- 30%

All per week

x 4

x 2

- 20%

Charges are generic: This means that all the effects of the item
draw power from the same pool of charges; most Magic-User staffs
are in this category. Items with generic charges are
automatically rechargeable; don't apply the normal adjustments
for this feature. Instead, combine the normal costs for the
charge pools of each effect (which must all have the same
number of charges), and then divide the charge cost, time and
chance adjustments by two. Thus, two effects sharing one pool
costs the same as a single effect with a single pool.

Item may be used by any class: By default, magic items may only
be used by the class that created them; so a wand of fireballs
is normally usable only by Magic-Users, or a staff of healing
only by Clerics. This feature allows the item to be used by any
class of character, and involves assigning simple command words
and gestures to the item. Adding this feature costs 1,000 gp
per effect. Note that all the item's effects do not have to be
covered; it is possible to create an item where some effects
may be used by any class, but other effects may only be used by
the creator's class.

[-- Image: Image14 --]Item operates continuously or
automatically: This feature supersedes both the charges and
item use features. The item works whenever properly worn, or
activates automatically when required. A ring of fire
resistance is a good example; also, the ring of invisibility is
in this category. Adding this feature multiplies the final cost
and time figures by five and applies a 40% penalty to the
chance of success.

Each feature above applied to a magic item will require a
valuable, rare and/or magical material to support the
enchantment. For example, a wand of fireballs has a spell
effect that is powered by charges; these are two relatively
ordinary features, so the Magic-User creating the item proposes
a rare wood for the shaft and a 1,000 gp value ruby for the tip.
The GM may, of course, require something more rare or valuable
if the magic item is particularly powerful.

The base cost of a spell effect feature can be reduced by 25% by
applying limits to the ability. For example, a ring of charm
dryad is an example of limited charm person spell effect, which
would qualify for the deduction. This does not affect the chance
of success or the time required.

Weapons which are to be enchanted with additional powers other
than the normal bonus require combining the standard weapon
enchantment rules with the rules given above. Perform the
weapon enchantment first; if it is successful, then the
character enchanting the weapon must immediately (within two
days, as previously explained) begin the spell or spell-like
power enchantment process. Failure of the second procedure does
not spoil the weapon enchantment.

Cursed Items

Some cursed items, such as cursed scrolls, are created that way
specifically by the spellcaster. The difficulty of creating
such an item is roughly the same as the difficulty of creating
a spell scroll of bestow curse.

Other cursed magic items may be the result of a failed attempt
to create a useful item. The GM must decide whether or not a
failed research project will actually create a cursed item.

Creating a Dungeon Adventure

1. Think About Why

When creating a dungeon, the first question you must answer is:
Why will your player characters risk going into this dangerous
dungeon full of monsters and traps?

Here are some possible scenarios:

To Explore the Unknown: This is common in pulp fiction. One or
more of the player characters has heard of some ancient site,
and wishes to explore purely for knowledge. Possibly some of
the other player characters are involved for other reasons.

To Battle An Evil Incursion: Goblins are raiding farms in the
area, and the Baron has offered a reward for stopping the
raids; the player characters are happy to help.

To Rescue A Kidnapped Victim: Some friend of the player
characters has been kidnapped, and they must sneak into or
storm the villain's tower/cave/dungeon to rescue the victim.
Or, perhaps, the victim is the son or daughter of the local
Baron or a wealthy merchant who offers a reward for the safe
return of his or her offspring.

To Fulfill A Quest: The local church, to whom the player
characters owe a favor, would like an ancient relic recovered
from a lost mountain fortress, and the High Priest asks them to
look into it; or some similar task might be assigned, depending
on who the player characters owe a favor.

To Get Loot: This is a surprisingly common scenario (well,
perhaps not so surprising). The dungeon is rumored to contain a
hidden treasure of great value, and the first characters to find
it will be rich! Of course, the treasure might not be that huge,
and might be guarded by any number of horrific monsters…

To Escape Confinement: The player characters have been captured
by an enemy, and find themselves incarcerated without their
weapons, armor, or equipment. This scenario must be used with
care, as the GM must not be seen to be “railroading” the
characters into the adventure.

There are many other possible scenarios, and each has many
variations. Knowing the answer to this question will make the
next questions easier to answer.

2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?

Is the dungeon beneath a ruined fortress, or an ancient wizard's
tower? Or perhaps it's a natural cave, which has been expanded
by kobolds… or the tomb of an ancient barbarian warlord,
guarded by undead monsters… there are many possibilities.

3. Choose Special Monsters

Now you know why the player characters want to go there (or why
they will, when they learn of the dungeon), and you know what
sort of place it is. Next, decide what special monsters you
will place within. For instance, the natural cave expanded by
kobolds contains kobolds, obviously, while the warlord's tomb
contains some undead, zombies and skeletons perhaps.

4. Draw The Dungeon Map

[-- Image: graphics79 --]Dungeon maps can be drawn on graph
paper in pencil, or created on the computer with any of a broad
variety of dungeon-drawing programs. (If you like the design of
the maps in the official Basic Fantasy RPG adventure modules,
be sure to visit www.basicfantasy.org and try out our map
designer, MapMatic +2.) When creating a dungeon for personal
use, there is certainly no good reason not to use pencil and
paper. Below is an example of a hand-drawn dungeon map, with
the various symbols noted:

5. Stock The Dungeon

“Stocking” the dungeon refers to assigning contents to each
room. There are several possibilities; a room might contain a
monster (which might or might not have treasure), a trap (which
might guard a treasure, or might not), an “unguarded” treasure,
a “special” (something other than a monster, trap, or treasure;
often a puzzle of some sort), or be “empty.”

The GM may choose the contents of any room, or may roll on the
table below:

d%

Contents

01-16

Empty

17-20

Unguarded Treasure

21-60

Monster

61-84

Monster with Treasure

85-88

Special

89-96

Trap

97-00

Trap with Treasure

An unguarded treasure will generally be hidden (such as in a
secret room, inside an unusual container, etc.) or protected by
a trap (a poison needle in the lock of a chest, or a poison gas
canister that explodes if the container is opened, or something
similar); such a treasure might even be hidden and trapped!
Again, some sort of saving throw should be allowed if a trap is
used. It's not a bad idea to hide a treasure so well that the
player characters are unlikely to find it; don't be concerned
if they don't. If you give away the location of all your
unguarded treasures, your players will not appreciate it
properly when they manage to find one by cleverness or luck.

A monster might be selected by the GM or rolled on the random
encounter tables. It's traditional that the first level (below
ground) contains monsters of 1 hit die or less, the second
level contains monsters of around 2 hit dice, and so on, but
the GM may choose to arrange his or her dungeon in any way
desired.

A monster with treasure might indicate a lair, or it might be a
group of monsters carrying loot, possibly camping for some
reason before moving on.

A trap is, obviously, some sort of device intended to harm the
player characters, including such things as pendulum blades,
hidden pits, spear-chucking devices, and so forth. A trap with
treasure is such a trap protecting a treasure, which might be
in the room beyond the trap or actually within it (such as in a
pit). See the Traps section, below, for more information.

A special might be a puzzle of some sort, such as a door that
can only be opened by a combination (hidden elsewhere in the
dungeon); or perhaps an oracle that answers questions about the
dungeon (but possibly it lies). The classic “magic fountain”
that randomly changes the ability scores of the drinker is
another possibility; if this is done, some sort of limit should
be imposed (such as, the device only affects a given creature
once, or the device causes harm more often than it gives aid)
to prevent abuse. In general, a “special” room is any room
containing something that either interests or obstructs the
player characters but is not a monster, trap, or unguarded
treasure.

Empty rooms contain no monsters, traps, unguarded treasures, or
specials. This does not mean that they are truly “empty;” a
room might contain a fireplace, upholstered chairs, side
tables, torch sconces, and curtains, and still be considered
empty. Hide a treasure in a secret drawer in a side table, and
it becomes an unguarded treasure room; in other words, to be
empty there has to be basically nothing of serious interest to
the player characters in the room.

6. Finishing Touches

The GM may wish to create one or more custom wandering monster
tables for the dungeon; monster patrols, if any, may need to be
described; and possibly some locations may have unusual sounds,
smells, graffiti, etc. which need to be noted. Don't spend too
much time on this, though.

Remember, if you only detail the “interesting” things, your
players will begin to guess what might be in a room. Some extra
description will help make things uncertain for the players. For
instance, a room with an unguarded treasure:

Game Master: This room contains a chest, centered against the
far wall.

Player 1: We look for monsters, and if we don't see any, the
thief will check the chest for traps.

Kind of boring, right? This might be better:

Game Master: In this room you see a comfortable-looking
upholstered chair, a side table and a foot stool. Two
burned-out torches are held by sconces on each wall.

Player 1: If we don't see any monsters, the thief will check the
table and the footstool for traps and see if anything is hidden
inside them, while the rest of us check for secret doors… one
of those sconces might open one.

A little extra detail can add a lot to the adventure.

Traps

Some suggestions of typical traps are listed below, to assist
the GM. Deadlier traps can be created by combining simple
traps, by making their effects harder to avoid, or by making
them capable of dealing more damage.

Traps are not necessarily reliable; the GM may choose to make a
roll of some sort for each potential victim until the trap is
sprung (say, 1-2 on 1d6). Or, a trap door might not open until
a given weight is placed on it, so that a lightly loaded thief
might cross without difficulty, only to see his heavily armored
warrior ally fall victim to it.

Alarm: Everyone within a 30' radius must save vs Spells or be
deafened for 1d8 turns by the loud noise. The GM should check
immediately for wandering monsters, which, if indicated, will
arrive in 2d10 rounds.

Arrow Trap: A hidden, mounted crossbow attacks at AB +1, doing
1d6+1 points of damage on a successful hit.

Chute: These are usually covered with a hidden trap door. The
triggering character must save vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity
bonus added) or tumble down to lower level of the dungeon.
Chutes usually do little or no damage to the victim.

Falling stones or bricks: Rocks fall from the ceiling. The
triggering character must save vs. Paralysis or Petrify (with
Dexterity bonus added) or take 1d10 points of damage.

Flashing Light: With a loud snap, a bright light goes off in the
face of the character that triggered the trap. That character,
and anyone else looking directly at it, must save vs. Spells or
be blinded for 1d8 turns.

Monster-Attracting Spray: A strong-smelling but harmless liquid
is sprayed on the triggering character. The smell attracts
predatory creatures, doubling the chances of wandering monsters
for 1d6 hours or until washed off.

Oil Slick: Oil is sprayed onto the floor of the room. Anyone
trying to walk through the oil must save vs Death Ray (with
Dexterity bonus added) or fall prone. Oil is highly flammable
and may be ignited by torches or other flame sources held by
characters who slip and fall into it.

Pit Trap: Usually hidden with a breakable cover, trap door, or
illusion. The victim must save vs Death Ray (with Dexterity
bonus added) or fall into the pit, taking damage according to
the distance fallen (see "Falling Damage"). A pit trap can be
made deadlier by placing spikes, acid, or dangerous creatures
at the bottom, or partly filling it with water to represent a
drowning hazard.

Poison Dart Trap: A spring-loaded dart launcher attacks at AB +1
for 1d4 points of damage, and the victim must save vs. Poison or
die.

Poison Gas: Gas emerges from vents to fill the room. All within
the affected area must save vs. Poison or die. Poison gases are
sometimes highly flammable and may be ignited by torches or
other flame sources, doing perhaps 1d6 points of damage to each
character in the area of effect (with a save vs. Dragon Breath
allowed to avoid the damage).

Poison Needle Trap: A tiny, spring-loaded needle pops out of a
keyhole or other small aperture and injects poison into the
finger of the character who triggered the trap (most likely, a
Thief trying to pick the lock), who must save vs. Poison or
die.

Portcullis: A falling gate blocks the passage. The character who
triggered the trap must save vs Death Ray or take 3d6 points of
damage.

Rolling Boulder Trap: A spherical or cylindrical rock rolls down
a slanting corridor. Anyone in its path must save vs. Death Ray
(with Dexterity bonus added) or take 2d6 points of damage.
Alternately, if the corridor has no other place for the
character to escape to (that is, no room for the character to
step out of the path of the rock), it may be necessary to
outrun the rock to avoid the damage.

Blade Trap: A blade or spear drops down from the ceiling or pops
out of the wall and attacks at AB +1 for 1d8 points of damage.
Particularly large blades might attack everyone along a 10' or
20' line.

Triggered Spell: When activated, a spell of the GM's choice is
cast, targeting or centered on the character who triggered it.
Popular choices include curses, illusions, or a wall of fire.

Designing a Wilderness Adventure

1. Think About Why

This is much the same task as was described above. The player
characters may enter a particular area looking for a town to
resupply from, a church or temple to provide healing services,
or for many other reasons. Once in the area, the Game Master
can make the player characters aware of adventuring
opportunities in the area, by means of rumors, posted bounties
(such as for raiding humanoids), quests offered by local
clergy, and so forth.

2. What Kind Of Setting Is It?

Decide whether the area is deep in the wilderness, or in more
inhabited territories, what sort of climate will be found
there, how many towns, and of what size, are present, and so
on.

You may choose to design a new territory based on the goals of
the player characters in your campaign. For example, if the
player characters decide to seek their fortunes in the richest
city in the world, you could decide where this is and begin to
describe it by providing rumors of its wealth and splendor told
by far-wandering merchants. If these descriptions intrigue the
characters and they travel toward the city, you will have time
to decide what terrain – and dangers – lie in their path.

On the other hand, your setting should make sense, which will
help players make meaningful choices when traveling. For
example, areas under human control will be settled, with signs
of civilization such as cleared land for agriculture, roads,
strongholds, etc. Areas dominated by humanoid monsters, or
which are being raided by wandering humanoids, will be
battle-scarred and will not have food or other goods available.
A valley that was settled many years ago but abandoned after a
dragon attacked could contain ruined buildings, their walls
likely still bearing the marks of flame and claw, and fields
grown high with saplings.

3. Draw An Area Map

Now it's time to draw the area map. Some Game Masters prefer to
draw maps freehand, while others like to use hex or graph
paper; of course, programs are available to create maps on a
computer as well. It is a good idea to provide a scale for the
map, which can be whatever best fits the map and the area you
want to depict. A scale of 18 miles per square or hex is a good
choice for a large-scale map, as this is the distance that a
group of humans can cover in a day in clear terrain (see
Wilderness Movement Rates), which makes it easy to determine
travel times.

Rivers and coastline, hills and mountains, forests and plains
must be clear on the map. All of these areas should have an
appropriate climate: for example, the windward side of a
mountain range will usually receive a great deal of rain, while
the other side will be dry. You may choose to create an area
with abnormal weather for its location, such as a sandy desert
in the midst of a rain forest, but this should be unusual, a
tip to observant players that strange magic is involved.

Go ahead and place any interesting sites such as towns, ruins,
and significant monster lairs. Remember, in most cases your
party of adventurers will need some base of operations, be it a
city, town, village, or border fortress.

4. Detail Interesting Sites And People

Describe at least the base town, and the dungeon you expect the
party to visit first. Also detail any set or placed encounters
you laid out in the step above. There is lots of room for
creativity here: a distant, unfamiliar town may have different
laws, traditions, or currency. You should also describe key
NPCs and their connections to each other. NPCs have their own
goals and plans, which may or may not involve the PCs, and the
actions of player characters toward one person will often
influence how others treat them. Don't go overboard trying to
detail every single place on the map… leave some room for
expansion later, after you have a feel for your players and
their characters.

5. Create Encounter Tables

When designing a wilderness area, one touch that will really set
it apart is a custom encounter table. Choose those monsters that
seem most appropriate to the area, using the standard encounter
tables as a guide. If you have placed humanoid lairs or
encampments, you may wish to include their patrols on the
custom table.

Another alternative is to roll six or eight or ten random
encounters using the “generic” encounter table for the relevant
terrain type, and use that list as your random encounter table
for the area. When doing this, you probably should re-roll
duplicates.

Strongholds

Many player characters, upon reaching higher levels, choose to
settle down and build a stronghold. Generally this is allowed
when a character reaches 9th level or higher. The player
character must obtain land on which to build; in some lands,
frontier territory may be made available to any freeman (or
freewoman) who can tame it; in others, land may be available
for someone with enough gold; while in other cases the
character will need to petition the local Count, Duke or King
for a land grant.

Usually, Fighters build castles, Magic-Users build towers,
Clerics build temples and Thieves build guildhouses, but this
is not always so. Any character who builds a stronghold
suitable to his or her class will attract 1st level followers
of the same class as follows:

Class

Number of Followers

Fighter

3d6

Magic-User

1d8

Cleric

2d8

Thief

2d6

These followers will assist the character, but will not go on
adventures away from the stronghold in most cases (especially
dangerous dungeon adventures). They live from the income
generated by the stronghold. The primary sources of this income
are taxes on peasants for castles, fees for magical services and
students' tuition for towers, tithing from the faithful for
temples, and criminal activities for guildhouses. A stronghold
must have 200 square feet of living space for each follower, as
well as quarters for guests, stables for horses, and so on.

[-- Image: graphics83 --]A player who wants to build a
stronghold should draw its floor plan. Each story is usually
10' tall. The construction costs for the stronghold are
determined by the square footage of its walls, floors and
roofs, the materials used, and the thickness of the walls.

Make sure not to double-count corners on walls that are 5' thick
or thicker – count the length of only one face. When determining
wall length for round walls and towers, approximate pi by 3,
since the inner face of the wall has a shorter circumference.
The table below gives costs in gp for each 10’ square section
of wall. The number by the material is its hardness, which is
deducted from damage to the wall.

A 1' thick wall is made of solid pieces of material held with
mortar (or pegs and ropes for wooden walls); such walls may be
at most 40' tall. A 5' thick wall consists of two 1’ thick
walls sandwiching 3’ of earth and rubble; such a wall may be at
most 60' tall. A 10' thick wall consists of a 4’ thick outer
wall and a 2’ thick inner wall sandwiching 4’ of earth and
rubble, and may be built up to 80' tall. A 15' thick wall
consists of a 6’ thick outer wall and a 2’ thick inner wall
sandwiching 7’ of earth and rubble; these walls may be built up
to 100' tall. To attain the maximum height, thinner walls can be
used on upper stories. For example, an 80 ft. tower must have at
least 20’ of 10’ thick walls at the base, but more could be
used.

The character will have to pay engineering costs for designing
the stronghold, and tall structures are more difficult to
design and to build. For each portion of the stronghold (wall,
tower, and so on), each 10' of height adds 10% to the costs in
both time and money. The GM should feel free to add a
multiplier to reflect the difficulties of building in a remote
area, obtaining materials, etc. In particular, if materials
need to be transported, they require 1 ton of cargo space per 5
gp of wood or stone construction. (The increased weight of stone
compensates for its compactness compared to wood.)

A building over 40’ high must have a solid foundation, and if
over 60’ high, it must rest on bedrock.

A stronghold requires one worker-day of construction labor for
every gp it costs to build. Adding more workers reduces
construction time, but the time cannot be reduced below the
square root of the time for one worker to build the stronghold.
Assume that there are 140 working days per year (seven months of
20 working days each) in temperate climates.

Floors and thatched roofs cost as much and take as long to build
as it would take to build the square footage of their bases of
1’ thick wood walls. Wood-shingled roofs cost twice this
amount and take twice as long to build, while slate-shingled
roofs cost four times as much and take four times as long. (You
don't need to calculate the greater surface area of a pitched
roof, since the increased height increases construction costs
enough to cover this.)

These costs include normal features of construction such as
stairs, doors and windows. Interior walls are not included;
they are usually 1’ thick. Parapets, which provide cover for
defenders atop castle walls and towers, are usually 1' thick
and 5' high (so they are half-cost).

Note that guildhouses are almost always built in cities and thus
are usually built with 1’ thick exterior walls, but they cost
twice as much to build due to the traps and secret passageways
that are designed into them. A Magic-User's tower costs three
times as much to build, due to the need for ancient books,
alchemical equipment, and other supplies for conducting
research.

For example, Sir Percy, a 9th-level Fighter, desires to build a
60’ tall square keep (50’ walls with a 10’ peaked
slate-shingled roof) that is 50’ square. The keep will have
four stories and an attic, and the first story, which will
contain the great hall, will be 20’ high. Sir Percy wishes his
keep to be strongly built, so he tells his architect to build
with hard stone and use 10’ thick walls for the first two
stories and 5’ thick walls for the rest. The first and second
floors will thus be 30’ square or 900 square feet, and the
third and fourth floors will be 40’ square or 1,600 square
feet. With a total floor area of 5,000 square feet, Sir Percy’s
keep will house him and up to 24 other people (or animals such
as horses, which during an attack may be stabled in the great
hall!) in acceptable comfort. Its floor plans are shown on the
next page.

The first floor has 30 (= 5 [for 50’ length] x 2 [for 20’
height] x 4 walls, minus 8 sections double-counted at the
corners and 2 sections for the entrance) 10’ square sections of
10’ thick hard stone walls, which cost 7,800 gp, and 9 10’
square sections of floor, which cost 90 gp, for a total cost of
7,890 gp. The second floor is the same as the first, except that
the walls are 10’ high and there is no deduction for an
entrance, giving a cost of 4,250 gp. The third and fourth
floors each require 18 sections of 5’ thick hard stone walls,
costing 1,620 gp, and 16 sections of floor, costing 160 gp, for
a total of 1,780 gp per floor. The 50’ square roof costs 4 x 25
x 10 = 1,000 gp, and the 40' square attic floor adds 160 gp.
The design calls for a total of 770’ of 1’ thick interior walls
and doors, which would cost 30,800 gp if made of hard stone; Sir
Percy uses wood, which costs only 7,700 gp. These costs total
24,560 gp, but since the keep is 60’ high, its cost is
increased by 60% to 39,296 gp. The keep will require 39,296
worker-days. Sir Percy may employ up to 198 workers to build
the keep, in which case it will take 198 working days to build,
or a year and three months’ time. Keep in mind what might happen
in this time, given that the area is dangerous enough to warrant
building a castle.

Dungeons: A stronghold may also have a dungeon excavated under
it. A dungeon is an excellent place to store perishable
supplies, a good shelter if the castle is overrun, and often
incorporates an escape route if all is lost for the castle’s
defenders or a secret way out for raids is desired. Magic-Users
sometimes encourage monsters to take up residence in their
dungeons, as they provide a convenient source of supplies for
magical research and help keep away unwanted guests. Use the
following figures for skilled workers, such as dwarves or
goblins, to create dungeons; double the times for less skilled
miners.

Material

Time for one worker to

excavate a 5’ cube

Earth

5 days (supports are required)

Soft stone

10 days

Hard stone

20 days

Structural strength and breaches: A section of stronghold wall
has as many hit points as its base cost in gp (for example, a
section of 10’ thick soft stone wall has 200 hit points). Stone
and brick walls only take damage from crushing blows, while wood
walls are also affected by fire and chopping attacks. If a given
section of wall loses all of its hit points, it is breached,
allowing attackers to pass through. If a breach occurs on a
lower course of wall, there is a 40% chance that the 10’
section above it will be breached by collapse, and a 20% chance
that the section below it will be breached. These secondary
breaches have the same chances of affecting the next 10’
section above or below them, and so on until the top or bottom
course of wall is reached. If a breach occurs on a right or
acute corner (90 degrees or less), the chances of breaches
double in each direction.

Attacking a Castle: Siege engines are difficult to aim, but as
castles don't dodge around, each successive shot by a given
siege engine with a given crew has an increasing chance of
hitting. To reflect this, the first attack on a castle's walls
is made against Armor Class 20; each subsequent attack by that
weapon, fired by that crew, at that same point in the wall, is
made against an Armor Class one lower than the previous shot,
to a minimum AC of 11.

Attacks on a castle's defenders are at -4 on the attack roll if
they are standing on the parapets, and at -10 if they are
behind arrow slits. Since characters defending the castle do
move around, the odds of hitting them with a siege engine do
not improve from shot to shot. There is an additional -2 on the
attack roll for missile attacks if the defenders are more than
20' higher than the attackers; this is not specifically due to
altitude, but rather because the defenders can use more of the
wall for cover. The defenders can take advantage of their
height by dropping objects on attackers near the castle's base;
these missiles do 2d10 points of damage, but they have a -2
attack penalty if dropped from a height of 30' or more.

Siege engines can damage several adjacent characters; roll
damage separately for each character in the 10' square hit by
the missile. Of course, the attack roll must be high enough to
damage each one; a roll of 19 against characters having Armor
Classes of 18 and 20 would hit the former but not the latter.

A castle may also be attacked by mining. This method of attack
involves tunneling under the castle wall, then setting fire to
the supports of the tunnel to cause the wall to collapse. It is
also slow, and if the castle has a moat, the tunnel must avoid
it, which requires that it be dug deeper, requiring twice the
time. A mine is dug like a dungeon, and once its supports are
fired, the wall above is breached; if the mine is only 5’ wide,
there is only a 50% chance of causing a breach.

Finally, a screw may be used to attack a stronghold. This
device, which costs 200 gp, is used to bore through castle
walls. A crew of at least eight is required to operate it. It
is only used at the base of a wall, and it is usually operated
under a sow, or portable roof, as it is slow. (A sow typically
costs about 100 gp.) The device does 1d8 points of damage per
turn, but it ignores hardness. A breach caused by a screw is
small, so it has only half the usual chance of spreading to the
next course of wall, unless widened by miners.

PRODUCT IDENTITY LICENSE

Subject to the terms of the Open Game License, above, you may
create derivative works based upon the Basic Fantasy RPG core
rules (this document). However, the Open Game License protects
the Product Identity (explained and detailed above) such that
you must have permission from the copyright holder before you
may use any of the listed Product Identity.

You may use certain items of the listed Product Identity under
the following conditions:

1. You must comply fully with the Open Game License, version
1.0a, as described above; and

2. The work may not be obscene in nature; in general, any work
containing subject matter that would qualify for an NC-17 movie
rating in the United States, or an R rating due to explicit
sexual content, is considered obscene for purposes of this
license.

If you comply with the above conditions, you may do either or
both of the following:

1. Include the text “Designed for use with the Basic Fantasy
Role-Playing Game” or “Designed for use with the Basic Fantasy
RPG”;

2. Use one or more of the official logos provided on the Basic
Fantasy Role-Playing Game website:

http://basicfantasy.org/logo.html

A logo may be resized as needed, but must not be distorted and
may not be altered other than to resize it, except as
specifically provided on that page.

If you wish to use other Product Identity from this work, you
must request and receive explicit permission from the copyright
holder.

In any of the above cases where the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing
Game Product Identity is used in your work, you must also
include the Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game website address
“basicfantasy.org” or "www.basicfantasy.org" in that work.
You may place the website address adjacent to the logo and/or
name, or you may include it on your title page, or place it in
some other location where any reasonably observant person would
expect to find it.

You may not under any circumstances describe your work as
actually being the "Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game" or some
derivative thereof, nor may you identify it as being in any way
an "official" publication of the Basic Fantasy Project without
the express permission of the author of this work.
