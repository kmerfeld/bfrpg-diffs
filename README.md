This repo contains some versions of the Core Rules for [Basic Fantasy RPG](https://www.basicfantasy.org/index.html)

I have removed images from these copies (because of the license(s) they are distributed under and for space) and converted them from `odt` files to `fodt` files.
`fodt` files are flat xml, and store more cleanly in git. They can be opened as normal in Libreoffice

I am also including a `txt` version to more easily see view diffs

you can see the `script.sh` file to see how this was done
